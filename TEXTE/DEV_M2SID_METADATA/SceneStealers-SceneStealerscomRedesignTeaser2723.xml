  <description><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.scene-stealers.com/" target="_blank">COMING SOON! Scene-Stealers.com</a> launches the 2.0 version of its popular offbeat movie website this Spring.<br /> Rock-drummer-turned-legit-<div>film-critic Eric Melin will become the community manager of the &#8220;Scene Stealers,&#8221; a group of unruly movie fans from across the globe who obsess over movies day and night. Scene-Stealers.com will be a fully interactive social-networking site where movie lovers can showcase their passionate hostility and take charge by rating films, reviewing films, making movie lists, building personal profiles, and finding people with similar tastes.<br /> All information from the Scene-Stealers community will be aggregated on the site, and by ignoring celebrity gossip and focusing on the content of the movies, Scene-Stealers.com will be the place to go for intelligent, informed, and off-the-wall opinions about movies. Ever wonder how that line gets drawn in the sand between a &#8220;credible&#8221; critic and everyone else? We are going to kick it right back in the faces of anyone who doesn&#8217;t think our opinions about movies matter. We&#8217;re the ones they make them for, after all. Now it&#8217;s their turn to listen to us.<br /><br /></div>]]></description>
