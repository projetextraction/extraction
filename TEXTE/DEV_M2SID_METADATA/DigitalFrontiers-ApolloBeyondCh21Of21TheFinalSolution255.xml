  <description><![CDATA[<p><span>Is there something special about the year 2012? What does it hold for us? Have there really been signs along the road that we&#39;re headed toward something big? Or do we simply see what we want to see? Coincidences?<br /></span></p><p><span><br />No matter which culture or Age, for thousands of years the common thread has been man&#39;s seemingly irresistible compulsion to tell stories to explain his reality, his world, his universe. We, as humans, love to tell stories. The stories have changed over the millenia, but the stories are still there nonetheless. Once we told stories of gods that rode across the sky to light up the day. Now, we tell stories of alien forces controlling our governments and abducting our people. Does it make any difference if it&#39;s true or not so long as someone is willing to kill over such beliefs?<br /></span></p><p><span><br />Da Vinci Code, Foucault&#39;s Pendulum. So many seemingly connected events, so much faith ultimately required. Are there truly conspiracies at work or just really observant, obsessive nut-jobs seeing things that aren&#39;t really there. Such people who don&#39;t have the sanity to apply Occam&#39;s Razor in their pursuit of the truth are dangerous. As long as it fits in with their belief system, they&#39;d believe there was a conspiracy in a bowl of cornflakes if they were told it was so.<br /></span></p><p><span><br />Whether it&#39;s 9/11, anthropogenic global warming, animal rights, gun control, or even a bowl of cornflakes, one should always take an overly healthy dose of skepticism with every bite of garbage that is thrown at them (from either side)--then chase it down with a little Occam&#39;s Razor and a splash of reality....just because things look connected doesn&#39;t always mean that they are.<br /></span></p><p><span><br />"It is still a beautiful world. Strive to be happy." --The Desiderata<br /></span></p><p><span><br /><br />From the Master&#39;s Thesis of:<br />Stephen Barker<br /><a href="http://digitalfrontiersmedia.com" target="_blank">http://digitalfrontiersmedia.com</a><br />Song Speckels<br /><a href="http://illustration4hire.com" target="_blank">http://illustration4hire.com</a><br /></span></p><p><span><br />Voice Over by Curtis Corlew<br /><a href="http://curtis.corlew.com" target="_blank">http://curtis.corlew.com</a></span></p>]]></description>
