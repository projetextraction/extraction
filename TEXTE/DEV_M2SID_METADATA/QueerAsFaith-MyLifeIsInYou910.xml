  <description><![CDATA[Blogging: I usually take the time when I&apos;m putting these post together to meditate on whatever is in my heart... it could be the topic of the song or something it reminds me. I just wanted to encourage you to take the time jot down a few things on your heart during worship... God speaks to our hearts and what better time to work out in what way God is tugging on our hearts. I&apos;ve been using these time to fellowship with you guys and gals, build bridges and as a personal time for myself to just take time to wait on the lord and seeing the Lord in those we meet, especially from backgrounds different than my own... this is an area that God seems to really putting on my heart.]]></description>
