  <description><![CDATA[While we&apos;re talking about justice and equality, we want to take a moment to honor the passing of a groundbreaking feminist, Del Martin. She co-founded the first national organization for lesbians in the United States, the Daughters of Bilitis in 1955. 1955 - imagine. <p>She was a true pioneer - the first Out lesbian elected the National Organization for Women, -- founding member of the Alice B. Toklas Democratic Club -- and founder of Old Lesbians Organizing for Change, fighting ageism and homophobia together. Together, Martin and Lyons wrote "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lesbian-Woman-Del-Martin/dp/091207891X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1220027008&sr=1-1">Lesbian/Woman</a>." Martin is credited for coining the term "battered woman" with her book "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Battered-Wives-Del-Martin/dp/0912078707">Battered Wives</a>"</p><p>Del Martin and her partner Phyllis Lyon became the first couple to legally marry in the United States on February 12, 2004 in San Francisco, California - after they had been together for more than 50 years. After that marriage was thrown out, they married again this June, when California became the second state to legally recognize same-sex marriage. She and Phyllis were two of the plaintiffs in the cases that won that marriage equality. </p><p>Del Martin died August 27, 2008 with her wife Phyllis Lyon at her side. She was 87 years old. We mourn her passing, and celebrate an extraordinary courageous feminist life that enriched us all.</p>]]></description>
