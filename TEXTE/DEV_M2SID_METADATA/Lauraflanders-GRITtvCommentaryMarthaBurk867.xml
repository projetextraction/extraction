  <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.marthaburk.org">Martha Burk</a> has a question. What are the candidates going to do for the majority? Not the moral majority or the "permanent" Republican majority Karl Rove dreamed up years ago. The permanent majority in this country is women. Oddly, though, we don&#8217;t hear much about what women want from either of the two leading candidates. In 2004 John Kerry made the mistake of not really addressing women&#39;s issues because he said it would just be pandering to another special interest. </p><p>Burk has some advice for both candidates. Talk to women for a change. Listen to the full commentary here. </p>]]></description>
