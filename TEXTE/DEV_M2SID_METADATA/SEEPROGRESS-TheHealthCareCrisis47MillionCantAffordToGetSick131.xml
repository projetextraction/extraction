  <title><![CDATA[The Health Care Crisis: 47 Million Can&apos;t Afford to Get Sick]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[<span><br />America&#39;s health system is in crisis, leaving out too many and costing too much. 47 million Americans lack health insurance. Millions more are struggling to pay premiums that are growing five times faster than wages, but still seeing their benefits shrink. While some Americans have access to the most sophisticated medical care in the world, others are left to overcrowded emergency rooms, under-funded clinics, or no health care at all - all because they lack the insurance it takes to provide for the care they need. This is wrong. It violates America&#39;s deep, long-standing commitment to fairness for all of our citizens - old and young, weak and strong. Unlocking our health care system&#39;s potential for everyone in America is the great moral challenge of our time. Center for American Progress Health Policy Director Karen Davenport explains what&#39;s at stake as President Bush prepares to deliver his final State of the Union address in ASK THE EXPERT, CAP&#39;s new video feature. <br /><br />www.AMERICANPROGRESS.org</span>]]></description>
