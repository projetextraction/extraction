  <description><![CDATA[Kate Bosworth and model boyfriend James Rousseau leave together from an after-party for &apos;Glamour Magazine Honors the 2008 Women of the Year&apos; in New York City. On their way out, a large crowd of paparazzi ask Kate to pose for them, but she just ignores them while talking to the fans and signing autographs. Every time she signs, she says "Thank you so much! I appreciate it!" as she walks down the line of fans. The paparazzi continue to beg for a photo, but she and her boyfriend just keep walking, however one sneaky paparazzi jumps in front of them and takes lots of photos as they walk, and you can hear someone in the background cheering for him "Yeah Doug! Get it done, brother. Get it done!" which makes Kate laugh hysterically.]]></description>
