You  know  all  about  this  stranger  danger  lie  line  here  in  central  Central  London  .  And  you  know  the  why  the  where  with  four  the  who  crew  and  we  simply  ask  in  the  name  of  your  son  Gordon  Luton  Savior  Jesus  Christ  that  you  will  continue  to  help  us  to  hear  he  what  you're  saying  .  And  to  be  obedient  to  watch  what  you're  your  calling  us  to  do  thank  you  ,  Lord  ,  for  all  those  who've  who  gathered  here  today  and  we  procure  your  blessing  on  this  us  in  the  name  of  our  Lord  and  Savior  Jesus  Christ  on  the  first  of  all  I  want  to  say  very  simply  that  I  consider  it  a  great  privilege  to  be  able  to  share  with  you  here  in  Great  Britain  today  ,  and  I  do  so  long  behalf  half  of  the  gaffe  gone  con  primates  Council  council  and  indeed  ,  on  behalf  of  an  extremely  lounge  large  multitude  of  our  brothers  and  sisters  .  Around  the  world  .  Believe  me  the  majority  of  Anglicans  in  the  world  ,  believe  that  the  Bible  is  the  word  of  God  .  and  that  Jesus  Christ  is  the  unique  Son  of  God  and  our  only  savior  I  do  so  .  Also  ,  because  as  your  colleagues  ,  we  want  you  to  know  that  we  view  the  situation  both  here  locally  and  throughout  the  world  as  extremely  serious  .  And  in  need  of  a  very  clear  response  .  This  is  a  crucial  moment  and  our  response  to  this  crucial  moment  will  be  one  for  which  we  will  be  accountable  I  had  a  very  interesting  conversation  on  an  aeroplane  over  very  long  ago  .  Well  when  ,  my  grandchildren  see  an  aeroplane  airplane  going  over  .  They  there  say  so  there  goes  grander  granddad  very  interesting  that  in  some  parts  of  the  world  .  When  people  see  this  .  They  might  they  want  to  go  and  sit  see  in  another  part  of  the  airplane  aeroplane  even  if  it  that  means  downgrading  in  my  part  of  the  world  .  They  like  liked  to  sit  next  year  .  well  ,  if  anything  happens  to  the  plane  .  They  know  who  to  hang  on  to  you  .  Sometimes  people  take  full  advantage  to  make  their  confession  compression  to  save  having  to  go  when  they  get  home  I've  not  yet  found  a  way  of  getting  around  round  that  .  What  do  you  do  when  the  Roman  Catholic  ,  has  confessed  to  an  Anglican  priest  I  don't  believe  there's  a  liturgy  ,  to  put  it  right  .  There's  as  yet  and  I  knew  that  this  particular  Stuart  Stewart  S  Hess  was  going  to  have  a  word  with  me  ,  just  by  the  way  she  fixed  on  me  as  I  got  on  the  aeroplane  and  we  had  a  very  pleasant  conversation  which  finished  with  those  words  ,  which  I'm  sure  you  are  extremely  familiar  with  oh  well  .  You  can't  really  be  sure  of  anything  anymore  more  .  Can  Kenya  you  and  I  had  to  say  ,  well  ,  my  dear  ,  I  do  hope  that  the  pilot  doesn't  share  your  philosophy  there  are  many  in  our  denomination  today  who  are  saying  you  can  can't  be  sure  of  anything  anymore  any  .  And  we  want  to  say  that  the  Bible  says  that  just  is  not  true  .  There  are  many  things  of  which  we  can  and  must  be  sure  because  God  has  spoke  God  had  the  first  word  and  God  will  have  the  last  word  .  So  let's  turn  and  thank  you  for  doing  the  introduction  from  for  me  Bishop  John  let's  turn  to  the  letter  to  the  Hebrew  now  I  ,  believe  me  ,  only  loudly  spreads  sprints  behind  this  because  when  we  were  in  the  green  room  before  this  meeting  ,  John  and  I  did  not  consult  about  this  so  you're  getting  it  right  .  John  I'm  from  Argentina  guys  does  come  off  up  the  he  Brewers  Braves  chapter  Chapter  two  we  must  pay  much  closer  attention  to  what  we've  heard  lest  we  drift  away  from  it  .  Christianity  is  about  what  we  have  God  has  spoken  it  is  a  message  that  has  is  been  being  heard  ,  and  received  ,  it  is  not  something  that  the  Senate  came  up  with  it's  not  something  that  the  a  Commission  commission  sorted  out  gold  Gold  spoke  and  we  there  is  a  very  real  danger  that  we  can  drift  away  from  it  .  Doesn't  require  very  much  it  simply  requires  that  you  do  nothing  when  I  was  a  lad  growing  up  on  the  southeast  south  coast  number  off  of  from  here  weeks  to  go  out  one  afternoon  a  week  on  the  English  Channel  and  I  remember  sitting  in  a  canoe  one  day  and  just  lying  back  and  relaxing  ,  just  for  a  few  moments  and  when  I  opened  open  my  eyes  I  was  almost  out  of  sight  of  the  British  press  you  don't  have  to  do  anything  just  let  a  bit  of  time  go  by  and  you  can  drift  and  you  can  drift  and  the  writer  goes  on  to  say  how  shall  Shell  we  escape  if  we  need  collect  collects  such  a  great  salvation  celebration  my  friends  .  This  is  important  this  is  extremely  important  because  it  is  a  our  salvation  Salvation  it's  about  life  and  death  .  And  it's  a  great  salvation  Christianity  is  about  called  rescuing  us  from  something  which  will  otherwise  destroy  us  internally  tenderly  we  call  called  to  pay  greater  attention  to  what  we've  heard  lest  less  we  drift  away  it  is  a  great  salvation  Salvation  because  it's  unique  .  There  is  no  other  weather  it's  a  great  salvation  Salvation  because  it  does  all  it  needs  to  do  once  you  believe  God  has  saved  you  it's  a  great  salvation  Salvation  because  God  himself  did  debate  debates  and  it's  a  great  salvation  Salvation  because  it  comes  from  the  heart  of  God  gold  and  tells  us  how  much  God  cares  and  how  much  God  loves  us  but  we  can  drift  away  from  if  we  do  not  pay  close  attention  so  what  have  we  specifically  done  Don  we  have  not  set  up  an  alternative  denomination  or  communion  we  are  the  original  McCoy  Anglicans  we  have  not  set  up  an  alternative  leadership  this  is  not  about  another  cockpit  where  there  are  other  pilots  flying  the  plane  .  We  have  not  divided  the  church  in  2000  and  three  when  accuse  accuser  ignore  the  voice  of  the  Anglican  Communion  we  have  simply  and  an  necessarily  I  phoned  found  affirmed  the  central  truths  of  the  Christian  faith  as  received  we  have  raised  the  standard  if  you  like  we  did  it  that  Lamberth  98  .  We  did  it  at  successive  prime  its  meetings  we  did  it  in  Jerusalem  last  year  and  we  know  that  many  of  you  here  in  the  UK  ,  stand  with  us  .  I  was  flying  over  the  part  one  chuckle  .  Many  years  ago  .  and  the  pilot  alarmed  we  me  suddenly  by  saying  ,  well  ,  look  ,  I've  never  been  here  before  .  Is  that  a  wrong  runway  way  down  fortunately  ,  I  had  and  was  able  to  say  that  is  a  runway  we  are  saying  this  is  the  runway  this  is  the  one  safe  place  to  land  and  to  take  all  there  is  no  we  haven't  hadn't  moved  it  and  we  haven't  moved  we  are  standing  where  Christians  have  stored  throughout  the  last  two  thousand  years  on  the  historic  biblical  Christian  faith  .  delivered  to  the  saints  and  received  receive  once  for  all  that  it  hasn't  changed  because  it  cannot  be  changed  and  still  remain  .  The  truth  it's  not  relative  it's  not  subjective  it's  not  a  question  of  interpretation  .  A  runway  is  a  runway  it's  revealed  plain  plane  truth  truths  and  you  cannot  change  the  foundation  of  our  retirement  salvation  and  security  .  Just  because  you  are  following  correct  institutional  procedures  why  was  it  so  necessary  .  Well  ,  first  of  all  ,  because  that's  what  we  call  called  to  do  we  are  called  to  preach  and  to  teach  and  two  of  and  to  two  proclaim  claim  and  to  defend  and  to  stand  on  this  unchanging  truths  truth  and  it's  very  clear  indeed  that  the  gospel  of  salvation  in  Jesus  Christ  is  not  being  proclaimed  in  general  throughout  much  of  the  Anglican  Church  church  in  the  West  west  ,  and  that  is  a  tragedy  .  Secondly  ,  it  was  necessary  because  it's  about  life  and  death  .  It's  a  the  salvation  Salvation  from  Sen  John  three  sixteen  says  for  God  so  loved  the  world  that  he  gave  give  it  gave  his  only  begotten  son  .  That  ,  too  two  ,  so  ever  believes  in  him  shall  not  but  having  have  lasting  mouth  everlasting  life  .  And  we  are  accountable  for  what  we  have  received  thirdly  ,  it  was  necessary  because  many  have  drifted  away  .  Fourthly  ,  it  was  necessary  because  false  teaching  has  been  introduced  firstly  ,  it  was  necessary  because  if  we  hadn't  moved  .  Then  the  Anglican  Communion  could  easily  have  been  taken  over  by  a  false  gospel  but  a  the  prime  its  it's  meeting  recently  a  conservative  archbishops  archbishop  said  there  is  a  hole  in  the  Anglican  boat  we  are  sinking  and  to  the  North  American  crime  prime  ,  it  said  .  It  won't  make  any  difference  .  In  post  modernism  it  does  not  work  in  the  real  world  as  God  has  created  it  .  So  what  has  happened  as  a  result  of  what  was  done  well  ,  it  was  very  interesting  to  observe  the  strident  and  swift  reaction  to  Gov  gone  ,  especially  here  in  the  UK  why  such  a  reaction  .  I'm  sure  many  have  asked  that  very  question  the  gospel  Gospel  true  plainly  stated  ,  has  always  been  resisted  throughout  history  .  And  it's  always  been  resisted  by  people  saying  we  are  modern  more  there  has  always  been  a  tendency  see  C  sea  for  this  generation  to  say  ,  that  was  all  right  for  them  .  But  we  are  the  modern  generation  ,  my  friends  .  Every  generation  has  said  the  same  thing  .  And  in  the  same  way  .  the  they  all  stock  stance  in  recent  years  has  been  vigorously  ,  not  to  say  violently  resisted  resist  in  North  America  .  In  an  open  way  .  And  here  in  the  UK  more  softly  .  True  orthodoxy  is  being  outlawed  obviously  ,  in  the  first  place  because  of  spiritual  warfare  if  the  vegan  fusions  chapter  Chapter  6  .  Has  it  all  and  we  must  remember  ,  we're  not  fighting  flesh  and  blood  .  This  is  about  spiritual  Principality  principality  some  powers  secondly  ,  orthodoxy  Orthodox  proclaims  one  unchanging  truth  .  At  a  time  when  that  is  unacceptable  within  Western  culture  .  Truth  has  become  relative  to  believe  in  one  truth  which  excludes  others  is  to  be  intolerant  and  dangerous  because  there  is  a  non  biblical  belief  that  Anglicanism  can  and  should  include  a  the  diversity  of  beliefs  ,  even  when  they  are  contradictory  .  Fourthly  there  is  a  false  force  view  of  institutional  loyalty  and  fifthly  ,  sadly  ,  there  is  a  great  fear  here  of  being  marginalized  .  And  finally  ,  I  believe  there  was  a  reaction  because  at  times  the  reaction  to  the  gospel  Gospel  is  just  plain  two  one  .  We  are  the  fragrance  of  death  debt  to  the  other  .  The  fragrance  of  life  and  finally  ,  what  is  likely  to  have  if  the  track  record  after  Lamberth  98  .  All  the  prime  primates  its  meetings  .  Lamberth  2008  .  And  on  the  recent  ACC  meeting  are  any  indication  ,  the  structures  of  the  communion  will  continue  to  seek  to  accomodate  accommodate  incompatible  and  an  antithetical  positions  even  though  the  prime  it's  plainly  said  set  in  Alexandria  in  February  of  this  year  .  We  do  not  believe  the  same  things  we  must  do  something  and  if  the  system  is  given  its  head  .  It  will  push  the  liberal  agenda  forward  .  And  since  no  synthesis  can  replace  the  gospel  Gospel  will  we'll  simply  swallow  true  true  so  unless  there  is  robust  and  clear  voice  in  this  part  of  the  world  ,  as  well  as  elsewhere  .  The  very  truths  true  of  Christianity  .  we're  not  only  not  be  affirmed  and  proclaimed  it  will  be  silenced  in  Anglicanism

Isn't  is  this  a  step  in  the  right  direction  .  Don't  you  think  .  Now  no  know  what  one  I  want  to  do  it  in  just  the  next  10  minutes  before  William  walks  over  and  tells  me  my  time  is  news  is  if  you've  got  a  Bible  .  I'd  like  you  him  it  to  turn  ten  with  me  made  ,  please  pleas  to  Philippines  chapter  Chapter  one  is  his  does  what  I  want  to  do  is  I  want  to  pick  up  on  the  half  ask  of  the  SCA  sci  CA  .  The  whole  concept  of  fellowship  and  what  that  means  in  the  New  Testament  the  word  coined  only  from  which  we  get  communion  Communion  .  Are  you  here  as  it's  its  translated  in  my  version  .  And  in  for  us  his  5  of  Philippines  Olympians  one  partnership  .  It's  all  the  same  idea  in  the  Church  of  England  .  We  often  worked  work  on  the  basis  of  the  area  air  due  juice  of  all  minimum  of  the  word  fellowship  Fellowship  on  worse  .  Witness  the  article  this  week  by  Colin  calling  crossed  in  and  in  the  Church  Times  which  seems  John  plied  ply  the  communion  with  Annie  ,  one  who  calls  themselves  Anglicans  ,  no  matter  what  they  believe  are  or  ,  how  they  live  ,  is  the  way  we  should  practice  and  behave  behaves  but  well  I  want  us  to  think  this  afternoon  about  what  fellowship  Fellowship  can  be  and  should  be  ,  according  to  the  New  Testament  and  Philip  against  hints  pins  this  lovely  checks  that  pull  Paul  loved  dearly  and  find  them  so  themselves  supportive  in  the  work  of  the  Gospel  gospel  flip  against  begins  lays  out  for  us  its  five  great  truths  about  what  fellowship  Fellowship  can  and  should  be  .  First  of  all  ,  and  this  is  where  it  all  begins  .  It  is  a  common  partaking  taking  .  Our  experience  of  the  grace  of  God  by  Press  7  .  It  is  right  for  me  to  feel  this  way  about  you  all  will  because  I  hold  you  in  my  heart  for  you  are  our  part  takers  with  me  of  grace  Grace  .  This  is  where  it  all  began  .  This  its  as  Paul  was  to  sum  summon  it  up  .  On  another  occasion  ,  which  in  many  ways  is  the  heartbeat  of  everything  ,  he  said  .  The  son  Son  of  God  loved  love  me  and  gave  himself  may  me  not  just  uses  Jesus  of  a  Basra  bouncer  but  the  Jesus  of  Nazareth  .  There  who  was  no  now  one  less  than  the  Son  son  of  God  he  loved  me  and  he  gave  himself  from  for  me  ,  or  is  as  the  Jerusalem  declaration  puts  it  in  an  article  5  we  we'd  gladly  loudly  proclaim  and  submit  to  the  unique  and  universal  lordship  of  Jesus  Christ  the  Son  of  God  humanities  humanity's  only  savior  say  from  Sen  judgment  and  how  who  to  live  lived  the  a  life  we  could  not  live  and  die  that  the  that  we  deserved  by  his  attending  to  and  glorious  resurrection  he  secured  the  their  retention  of  all  who  come  to  him  in  repentance  and  faith  .  A  common  experience  of  the  grace  of  God  ,  the  Son  of  God  ,  love  me  and  gave  himself  .  For  me  ,  and  he  took  the  punishment  that  was  mined  mine  by  right  upon  his  holy  home  wholly  showed  us  .  Secondly  ,  that  I  concern  concerned  to  defend  and  proclaim  the  Gospel  you  see  these  people  who  work  were  in  fellowship  with  Paul  .  We're  not  just  in  fellowship  Fellowship  in  believing  the  same  thing  ,  you  have  of  an  experience  of  the  grace  of  God  ,  but  they  were  the  kind  of  people  who  rolled  up  their  sleeves  in  the  course  of  the  Gospel  at  that  the  breeze  Brees  commenting  about  the  word  translated  partnership  coin  Coyne  Anya  Anglia  in  first  us  five  talks  about  it  being  energetic  wholehearted  mess  here  were  where  people  who  were  energetic  in  their  the  willingness  to  defend  and  proclaim  the  Gospel  and  Paul  poor  mentions  that  in  for  first  a  17  ,  1st  7  for  free  you  world  all  partake  heartache  is  with  me  of  price  by  in  my  imprisonment  and  in  the  defense  and  confirmation  of  the  Gospel  .  It  wasn't  the  only  Paul  ,  who  is  was  defending  the  gospel  Gospel  in  and  confirming  it  .  They  were  standing  with  him  and  in  doing  the  same  thing  .  Brothers  and  sisters  .  Given  the  presenting  issue  facing  the  church  .  At  the  moment  .  If  we  change  what  the  New  Testament  tells  us  ,  and  the  apostles  Apostles  towards  us  need  mean  to  be  repentant  of  then  we  change  changed  the  gospel  Gospel  and  we  cannot  allow  to  happen  now  might  say  am  I  impressed  by  those  who  stand  a  to  leaf  from  those  who  in  North  America  .  Have  sought  to  defend  the  Gospel  gospel  against  heresy  and  against  again  secularism  by  the  creation  of  a  ACMA  CNA  some  in  our  country  who  had  claim  claimed  the  name  of  evangelical  who  claim  claimed  to  be  concerned  about  the  gospel  Gospel  are  sniffy  arson  and  iffy  if  about  AC  C  and  an  early  ,  it  ought  not  to  be  the  case  .  We  ought  to  be  standing  with  brothers  and  sisters  in  Christ  in  the  defense  and  proclamation  of  the  Gospel  the  third  thing  we  notice  noticed  about  what  ship  fellowship  Fellowship  means  in  the  New  Testament  is  that  it  is  partnership  in  prayer  .  It  is  well  known  ,  of  course  ,  look  at  press  ,  19  that  Paul  always  prays  praise  with  joy  for  those  churches  Yadav  founded  it  or  had  connections  with  .  But  what  is  not  always  as  well  recognized  recognize  is  that  he  covets  their  prayer  for  him  .  Of  all  the  things  that  we  need  to  take  to  heart  about  what  fellowship  Fellowship  means  practically  .  This  is  so  important  and  so  easily  neglected  .  It  is  the  weapons  of  our  warfare  the  spiritual  weapons  of  our  all  warfare  as  a  network  as  a  fellowship  and  to  pray  for  one  another  .  The  fourth  Markov  mark  of  what  fellowship  Fellowship  can  and  should  be  as  mapped  out  here  for  us  is  in  first  for  27  Paul  Paula  ,  who  remember  was  chained  to  a  Roman  soldier  uses  a  military  analogy  I  long  to  hear  that  you  are  standing  firm  in  one  sprayed  spread  spirit  with  one  mind  striving  striding  side  by  side  for  the  faith  fate  of  the  Gospel  gospel  and  not  frighten  anything  by  your  opponents  .  The  military  analogy  is  the  picture  of  Roman  soldiers  locking  their  shields  even  in  the  face  of  being  hugely  outnumbered  and  still  winning  through  .  Why  because  they  did  not  allow  and  end  an  may  May  Ainge  Inge  between  their  shields  they  locked  lock  them  together  and  they  stood  together  fellowship  Fellowship  .  What  that  that  pick  biblical  family  ship  as  it  can  and  should  be  is  like  minded  servant  servants  hearted  commitment  to  live  their  for  a  price  prize  ,  and  to  pull  together  under  commitment  to  the  truth  of  the  Gospel  and  the  upper  story  stalling  fate  faith  with  a  generous  orthodoxy  and  a  love  for  one  another  .  And  fifthly  ,  and  finally  and  and  for  this  we  need  to  move  over  to  the  end  of  the  book  very  practically  Paul  uses  the  same  word  again  in  first  verse  15  of  Chapter  4  and  you  new  Philippines  yourselves  know  that  in  the  beginning  of  the  Gospel  gospel  well  when  I  left  Macedonian  no  church  Church  entered  into  partnership  with  me  and  in  giving  and  receiving  ,  except  accept  you  only  here  was  a  group  of  Christians  that  even  in  polls  Paul's  experience  where  you  make  need  they  gave  poor  Paul  practical  support  financial  support  gets  to  help  in  the  in  ministry  and  Paul  says  .  This  is  a  wonderful  evidence  of  spiritual  life  in  them  .  That's  what  brings  him  most  drawing  join  joined  up  against  gifts  themselves  .  But  the  evidence  of  spiritual  life  that  but  they  show  as  we  review  these  five  things  coin  Coyne  no  near  communion  union  file  foul  issue  in  the  New  Testament  means  a  common  experience  of  the  grace  of  God  as  we  come  to  the  foot  of  the  cross  and  see  who  it  was  who  loved  us  and  gave  himself  for  us  and  welcome  welcomed  him  as  Lord  and  Savior  it  is  about  rising  to  the  defense  and  proclamation  of  the  Gospel  together  .  It  is  about  a  prayerful  support  for  one  another  .  It  is  it's  about  networking  working  together  and  praying  for  one  another  .  Fourthly  ,  it  is  about  pulling  together  with  a  servant's  heart  and  the  a  determination  to  that  nothing  divide  us  .  And  fifthly  ,  it's  about  practical  giving  practical  material  help  and  support  .  That  is  what  the  Fellowship  of  confessing  Anglicans  should  be  about  .  And  by  the  grace  of  God  is  a  of  vice  ice  .  May  God  by  his  love  and  grace  .  Make  it  so  that  these  five  biblical  Biblical  marks  of  on  trade  trend  fellowship  Fellowship  are  our  true  of  us  to  too  to  the  glory  of  God  to  our  blessing  blessings  and  to  the  be  extension  of  his  kingdom  . 
9;1233.49;Anglicantv-FCA2009InterviewWithArchbishopJensenAndArchbishopVeneabl988;eng-usa;10;1017;religion;Watch;['anglicantv']; have  been  particularly  for  this  day  diet  and  control  process  Martin  gun  battles  as  a  mouse  my  it's  costly  ,  but  it's  it  worth  it  .  The  date  day  has  been  launched  guy  die  of  the  Fellowship  confessing  Anglicans  here  in  the  UK  and  it's  its  flow  get  on  .  It's  a  sort  of  one  of  the  great  consequences  of  Defcon  gas  guest  ,  and  I  think  it's  going  gonna  to  great  that  difference  deference  to  the  nature  of  Christian  faith  and  and  an  activity  here  in  the  UK  .  It's  been  good  we  flew  over  an  and  ocean  as  well  .  I  should  sure  but  first  through  threw  all  the  way  from  from  one  of  scientists  will  be  been  here  ,  which  is  is  a  long  ,  long  way  to  too  because  basically  we  care  very  much  about  what's  happening  in  the  Christian  church  felt  to  clean  the  Anglican  Communion  and  we  know  there's  a  lot  of  concern  about  what's  going  on  in  the  United  Kingdom  we  noticed  something  very  interesting  .  When  we  put  out  in  Jerusalem  that  flourish  people  in  the  UK  said  that  we  agree  with  that  .  So  our  question  is  what  would  were  in  taken  the  to  Denver  do  .  You  know  ,  it's  one  thing  to  say  you  agree  with  that  .  But  there's  a  whole  world  out  there  in  this  particular  countries  over  60  million  people  who  are  living  and  dying  .  Many  of  them  .  We've  with  will  never  hearing  about  the  Lord  Jesus  Christ  .  So  we  feel  ,  especially  in  the  light  of  come  Capcom  that  God  is  calling  believers  to  stand  up  and  say  ,  I  really  do  don't  believe  in  the  Lord  Jesus  Christ  ,  I  believe  .  Not  only  does  it  make  a  difference  in  my  life  but  I  believe  the  world  needs  to  hear  about  it  and  ,  basically  ,  this  new  fellowship  that  has  been  launched  there  here  in  Westminster  today  is  to  just  gather  like  minded  like  believing  people  together  to  be  able  to  do  something  about  it  to  do  mission  together  and  to  stand  together  ,  just  as  selfish  you  Peter  to  master  together  in  of  many  years  ,  and  supported  support  each  other  and  ,  and  and  encourage  one  another  and  played  prayed  with  one  another  ,  just  to  let  that  go  on  spreading  throughout  the  world  ,  in  particular  in  this  part  of  the  world  where  in  past  years  ,  the  Gospel  gospel  was  sent  out  through  the  lives  of  men  and  women  ,  sometimes  as  martyrs  and  now  it's  time  for  Britain  to  stand  up  again  and  say  ,  yes  ,  we  want  to  hear  about  Jesus  .  And  this  falls  follows  directly  on  the  heels  of  act  that  now  and  on  the  in  end  the  in  keeping  killing  in  North  America  and  in  think  England  church  Church  in  of  North  America  .  I  was  that  at  deliberate  or  is  that  just  coincidence  .  It  wasn't  planned  but  neither  is  there  a  conspiracy  .  This  is  isn't  a  conspiracy  and  in  which  we  just  is  not  bright  enough  talk  talking  nice  us  things  like  that  ,  but  it  just  happens  in  God's  timing  the  that  one  follows  on  from  the  other  .  What's  happened  in  the  States  states  and  North  America  in  general  has  happened  because  of  a  very  ,  very  serious  situation  there  .  Here  in  the  UK  is  it's  far  more  subtle  and  we  don't  think  it's  anywhere  in  the  circumstance  that  you're  seeing  in  the  states  States  that  there's  there  likely  to  be  such  a  major  separation  .  But  there  is  a  separation  .  Nonetheless  ,  and  there's  is  a  real  need  for  help  and  for  people  to  know  what  to  do  ,  so  that  they  are  not  forced  to  wait  away  from  the  proclamation  of  the  cross  grass  well  ,  here  it  seems  that  like  you  can't  care  30  years  behind  the  States  where  were  we're  ,  in  30  years  ago  to  the  seminaries  were  invaded  made  conveyed  about  by  it  that  .  The  liberal  theology  and  in  so  sort  of  have  the  leadership's  leaderships  investors  and  stuff  ,  but  at  with  that  a  the  source  for  him  to  take  place  here  in  England  as  well  .  But  I  think  others  is  too  simple  an  account  of  what  what's  happened  here  street  culture  ,  take  a  the  different  cultures  are  counted  account  .  But  the  that  one  of  the  key  issues  Gaston  guest  for  Aetna  and  now  for  this  part  of  the  world  sees  it  that  ,  you  can't  preach  the  gospel  of  the  yes  Yes  of  have  God  gone  without  preaching  the  gospel  of  them  know  of  quality  coffee  .  I  heard  a  that  famous  liberal  theologian  on  the  television  .  The  here  last  time  I  was  here  he  talking  about  Jesus  and  and  it  this  was  is  wonderful  .  He  always  said  I  agree  with  that  .  He  was  so  warm  about  Jesus  and  trusting  in  Jesus  wasn't  afterwards  organizing  organized  never  said  a  word  about  repentance  .  He  it  never  said  a  word  about  the  exclusive  claims  crimes  of  Jesus  ,  and  so  the  Jesus  GCSE  he  presented  us  with  was  a  half  Jesus  .  Ultimately  ,  if  of  a  all  false  students  now  ,  what's  going  gonna  to  happen  is  going  gonna  to  have  a  full  gospel  of  gospel  ,  in  which  the  great  yes  of  God  is  he's  it's  also  set  aside  ,  and  if  he  says  yes  ,  it  doesn't  mean  that  there's  is  no  repentance  real  .  If  he  says  yes  ,  it  doesn't  mean  that  forgiveness  can  occur  without  across  cross  so  this  is  a  key  issue  in  this  country  .  One  of  these  days  ,  that  it  hasn't  happened  already  .  There's  there  going  to  be  a  move  at  an  official  level  to  endorse  what  the  Bible  above  calls  all  seem  him  seen  or  all  there's  this  going  to  be  a  move  at  an  official  level  really  two  to  sides  he  received  heresy  true  and  what  today  is  about  is  getting  ready  for  that  their  moment  man  ,  so  said  the  that  Christians  who  believe  both  wealth  great  greater  yes  ,  right  now  ,  we've  got  to  be  the  really  ready  region  combined  Montague  standing  steady  and  simply  Simon  these  false  doctrines  arrives  arise  that's  not  true  .  Now  ,  for  a  while  .  We've  been  in  what's  what  been  it  called  the  listening  listing  process  in  the  in  the  church  in  regards  to  awareness  one  10  .  In  the  winter  Windsor  constitution  stopping  stuff  that  this  is  the  end  of  the  listening  part  I  would  say  that's  a  all  lie  I  been  then  working  through  this  process  for  a  long  ,  long  time  since  before  London  Lamberth  ninety  there's  but  a  lot  of  this  these  talk  about  listening  he's  is  very  pointed  .  I  don't  think  there  they're  really  has  been  two  to  sided  slide  listening  I  think  there  has  been  a  very  subtle  force  which  has  said  we  and  a  I  talk  about  this  listening  thing  and  Indian  in  India  Georgia's  Georgia  kit  get  worn  down  and  you  will  get  give  off  up  and  hopefully  you  go  away  ,  and  then  and  we'll  will  be  able  to  get  on  with  what  we  want  to  do  what  I  can't  interpret  it  any  other  way  .  But  tell  you  why  what  a  I  sailor  say  from  our  part  of  the  world  .  We  have  been  making  a  very  clear  stand  for  the  cost  .  We've  taken  on  board  churches  church's  dioceses  and  nobody's  nobody  invited  me  to  existing  a  to  do  anything  with  we  major  made  may  somebody  would've  would  picked  up  the  phone  .  This  guy  any  morning  apostate  up  and  in  one  because  the  time  difference  between  when  a  the  site  aside  Saudis  side  and  isn't  an  and  Sydney  .  The  phone  rings  high  paid  high  quite  grade  .  Are  A  you  doing  and  we  talked  talk  .  That's  what  why  call  the  listing  listening  process  Christmas  and  I  really  how  have  serious  doubts  about  that  .  The  same  way  .  I  have  serious  doubts  about  the  church  in  the  UK  ,  which  says  its  it's  Orthodox  orthodox  but  it  does  not  preach  a  clear  gospel  of  salvation  and  if  you  look  at  the  theology  .  If  you  look  at  everything  that's  been  going  on  in  this  part  of  the  vote  world  road  to  lodge  and  you  examine  it  closely  .  You  will  notice  what  isn't  there  then  .  If  you  look  closely  ,  and  I  can  can't  tell  you  what  why  isn't  there  redemption  isn't  there  isn't  the  story  this  of  called  gold  creating  the  human  race  .  The  human  race  rebelling  against  God  and  God  in  his  life  ,  sending  his  son  to  give  his  life  on  the  cross  across  .  The  directors  of  you  do  not  hear  it  and  if  you  do  hear  here  it  ,  then  people  began  begin  to  get  very  ,  very  uncomfortable  ,  just  as  they  call  got  go  uncomfortable  a  and  .  We've  with  got  to  come  calm  and  in  then  the  Jerusalem  state  statement  now  ,  from  Cantor  cancer  rate  to  London  are  you  find  finding  a  lot  of  empty  two  churches  in  the  in  changing  thinking  in  other  the  churches  church  .  There  their  are  parents  a  are  to  vastly  10  of  post  Christian  Europe  arm  .  What  work  can  in  you  the  fellowship  Fellowship  confession  fishing  official  officially  Anglicans  do  to  change  that  .  Well  ,  the  same  is  true  in  Australia  to  Australia  and  Europe  you're  pre  pretty  similar  Civil  civil  and  unlocking  on  says  onstage  America  so  we  too  have  great  missionary  ahead  us  that's  .  The  wonderful  thing  about  the  firmest  finish  finishing  of  confessing  Anglicans  ,  said  people  think  it's  only  Sony  if  is  I  think  it's  all  built  on  saying  no  ,  there's  there  something  which  which's  is  unmentionable  where  wears  where's  really  it's  all  positive  .  One  of  the  most  striking  elements  element  of  some  that  week's  we've  we  received  death  guest  on  from  last  year  was  the  emphasis  ,  particularly  vertically  from  the  African  brothers  on  transformation  of  life  and  on  preaching  the  gospel  planting  churches  and  of  all  that  last  not  night  only  he  said  say  so  the  impact  of  the  fellowship  Fellowship  on  Australia  Australian  Christians  has  been  positive  .  And  it  will  grow  more  and  more  positive  as  we  going  can  gonna  get  in  fellowship  with  that  people  from  all  round  the  world  .  There's  a  real  interest  in  seeing  in  Jesus  Falkland  Jesus  and  preaching  Jesus  in  a  sense  the  .  I  think  the  they  old  Anglican  Communion  will  creep  along  .  But  the  reality  is  that  modern  methods  of  communication  in  the  making  fans  all  so  around  the  world  and  just  get  in  touch  with  each  other  and  help  each  other  with  the  a  great  task  SCI  sci  if  it  that  encompasses  accomplishes  everything  anything  is  going  to  be  great  mission  nation  now  the  Church  of  England  since  we've  we  been  should  departure  show  Cho  and  in  troops  church  since  seems  growing  going  everywhere  except  the  leaders  are  ,  here  in  and  in  the  Church  of  England  stand  right  in  Africa  .  It's  20  minutes  if  asked  us  ,  but  we  you  know  now  no  the  that  other  ,  for  four  instance  ,  unity  unit  seemed  seem  to  be  congested  and  buses  .  It's  going  one  when  a  man  amendment  missing  there  I  think  it's  simply  because  the  leadership  is  does  not  doing  what  the  leadership  should  do  also  ,  with  enormous  respect  and  a  great  sense  of  sympathy  .  It's  is  not  an  easy  time  to  live  as  a  Christian  ,  but  the  leadership  .  It's  is  this  called  school  to  set  the  example  in  its  time  lifestyle  ,  and  in  its  message  we  begin  beginning  to  recreate  in  Latin  America  .  The  whole  hole  concert  ,  but  from  the  early  years  of  the  church's  Church  missionary  bishops  bishops  patients  who  to  go  out  and  do  the  work  of  in  Angeles  go  out  and  create  churches  go  out  and  do  battle  against  supporters  of  the  bill  evil  really  take  on  what  is  the  the  gospel  Gospel  .  And  that  is  the  lead  ship  struck  the  leadership  a  case  proceed  courtesy  as  we  read  really  it  biblically  it's  a  pastoral  ministry  .  And  it's  a  preaching  ministry  in  some  ministry  industry  which  take  takes  seriously  what  are  we  called  call  to  do  is  it's  not  accepted  second  .  Or  all  you  might  have  to  do  those  things  ,  but  that  is  the  that  very  there  secondary  issue  .  The  real  issue  is  about  Christian  leadership  Leadership  ,  and  now  being  an  authority  as  Christian  leaders  .  And  I  think  we've  got  rethink  not  present  a  model  .  What  we  are  concerned  about  is  that  those  who  do  believe  in  this  country  first  foreign  four  are  ever  Narendra  able  to  stand  up  and  then  let  just  spread  like  the  fire  spread  because  across  I'm  aren't  convinced  many  people  in  this  country  who  have  some  sort  of  Christian  background  and  they're  just  waiting  for  somebody  someone  to  tell  them  about  Jesus  ,  and  we  want  these  guys  cars  and  and  and  women  that  we've  been  shown  with  today  and  young  people  just  to  be  able  to  stand  up  and  do  that  free  freely  freedom  and  or  not  think  this  is  something  not  but  to  realize  that  that  is  the  norm  .  Jesus  came  to  set  us  on  fire  ,  not  to  tell  tennis  Tennessee  tenants  this  there  there's  and  no  other  types  tests  of  three  more  restructuring  within  the  Church  of  England  one  spot  my  I  stuff  started  their  the  house  houses  Hollis  use  used  different  some  the  things  militants  that's  it's  come  from  before  and  he's  called  look  out  how  for  far  this  it's  its  truly  Terry  cherry  tight  .  The  there  is  the  Church  of  England  as  that  had  at  many  of  these  societies  society's  .  But  this  is  isn't  that  in  any  if  I'm  well  ,  it's  not  really  knows  a  the  great  spiritual  movement  and  actually  in  in  its  it's  it  strangely  and  interestingly  ,  has  brought  together  people  from  abroad  churchmen  ship  around  a  central  stream  streams  .  The  Lord  Jesus  Christ  ,  and  then  that's  going  to  be  uncomfortable  that  the  we  study  certainly  .  We  have  had  not  only  been  doing  that  .  But  today  to  ,  just  the  feedback  Ackerman  them  speaking  said  passionately  about  Jesus  and  then  to  see  William  Taylor  on  stage  onstage  doing  his  thing  is  to  see  the  coming  together  of  two  strands  around  a  central  theme  of  Sarah  Sara  commitment  to  Jesus  and  a  passionate  belief  in  mission  Mission  now  yes  .  This  is  a  big  movement  and  don't  I  of  know  the  that  other  .  This  it  is  not  the  answer  .  Tourists  in  the  Anglican  Church  church  .  But  this  is  a  big  movement  for  four  Avengers  and  some  the  Gospel  gospel  and  I  think  it  is  a  movement  move  Stewart  Mr  he  you  talked  before  about  the  unity  and  how  you  overcome  except  for  issues  of  salvation  well  women's  for  been  the  nation  nation's  Coronation  stuff  at  that  .  How  house  is  it  that  all  played  out  will  and  now  we'll  when  miss  we  you  can  get  season  seeking  got  but  it  if  ,  you  put  Jesus  first  slide  slug  sled  when  you  punish  is  about  suppose  ,  yet  yeah  yes  is  it's  important  first  bought  back  into  the  first  pump  bomb  all  and  the  than  then  the  many  other  buttons  ,  came  to  the  right  place  .  We  had  today  here  people  there  who  would  die  rather  than  where  wear  stole  or  all  make  the  sign  of  the  cross  and  we  had  have  sitting  next  to  the  people  who  would  die  rather  than  not  .  Where  is  still  a  major  sign  of  the  cross  both  in  love  with  Jesus  and  am  both  convinced  by  the  Christian  Gospel  .  This  is  a  new  coming  together  .  The  but  cost  got  is  organized  human  beings  could  make  that  happen  and  we  ever  had  learn  some  wonderful  things  .  The  question  of  the  ordination  of  women  is  he's  not  the  a  Salvation  salvation  celebration  issue  which  is  it's  a  very  serious  and  important  issue  ,  but  it  is  not  something  we  divide  do  the  Church  church  over  a  lively  largely  rather  now  not  there's  do  something  very  ,  very  special  is  gonna  come  it's  already  there  warily  wearily  only  already  living  then  English  this  unity  .  But  we  want  people  in  England  to  realize  there's  a  well  known  as  other  Christians  out  there  ,  maybe  with  different  accents  ,  maybe  with  with  with  different  colored  skin  or  whatever  ,  but  this  is  about  the  worldwide  Worldwide  church  Church  .  But  and  am  I  really  believe  that  this  from  a  ship  that  has  been  launched  .  It's  is  going  gonna  to  be  a  wonderful  part  of  that  ,  so  that  people  with  what  Peter  saying  as  well  will  .  The  networking  ability  to  communicate  .  I'm  I  just  gonna  cannot  suddenly  begin  began  to  move  in  a  way  that's  this  kind  of  really  surprise  surprised  some  people  and  suddenly  all  the  negatives  just  going  can  to  appeal  appear  .  Well  ,  that's  a  problem  ,  but  this  is  the  main  thing  we  should  be  doing  the  differences  on  a  the  matter  medal  metal  out  what  the  ordination  of  women  .  But  there  are  people  in  the  Church  of  England  and  people  in  this  movement  who  are  who  are  deeply  utterly  opposed  .  There  are  people  who  are  absolutely  for  floors  now  in  it  appears  as  is  the  in  North  America  and  also  here  hear  if  this  you're  absolutely  opposed  to  post  it  which  being  squeezed  out  of  the  church  churches  and  what  the  people  who  are  40  hundred  and  assigned  .  We  don't  want  all  will  issue  we  don't  issue  .  We  want  to  make  such  arrangements  within  our  total  outside  outshone  church  structure  that  you  can  remain  with  integrity  .  Now  that's  the  difference  and  then  secondly  as  as  it  might  be  give  a  problem  has  said  .  Now  ,  let's  talk  about  as  well  ,  because  this  is  an  issue  which  in  many  ways  ,  hasn't  been  properly  tore  talked  through  yet  .  Although  the  film  that  there  for  20  years  0  .  It  this  hasn't  been  tortured  talked  properly  probably  .  Yet  yes  and  we  we're  still  seeking  the  them  one  of  them  the  all  .  But  while  we're  we  seeking  see  the  model  my  .  Let's  not  squeeze  each  other  out  .  The  church  .  That's  the  danger  and  I  don't  want  to  see  how  Anglo  England  Catholic  friends  have  to  leave  the  church  is  over  that  issue  simply  because  people  have  not  been  generous  enough  to  give  them  space  images  church  but  there  now  two  to  more  our  questions  Hala  finish  for  put  the  Anglican  Church  in  North  America  .  The  they  town  can  had  have  a  common  enemy  that  help  helped  them  gather  gathered  together  all  these  different  coming  common  kind  prospectors  printers  and  then  they  discovered  that  that  can't  last  forever  ,  and  the  they  discovered  Discovery  mission  for  the  Church  is  that  something  that  the  Fellowship  confessing  inferences  scrapping  tuition  thanks  to  very  early  days  ,  but  I  think  yes  ,  I  think  one  thing  that  marks  the  Christian  witness  in  this  country  is  it's  it's  very  local  and  worst  almost  individual  around  local  parishes  ,  but  that  is  he's  now  gonna  going  take  momentum  as  is  everybody  really  realize  realizes  is  that  this  is  a  worldwide  movement  .  There's  a  movie  move  those  periods  period  in  pragmatic  ways  that's  really  moving  people  .  I  think  it  will  happen  gradually  ,  but  it  won't  happen  as  dramatically  as  it  did  is  in  the  States  states  because  of  the  way  things  panned  pan  out  in  the  States  and  in  in  in  a  similar  way  and  in  in  Canada  but  yeah  ,  it's  going  to  be  happening  and  when  I  sit  it  down  with  you  within  him  in  five  years  from  now  ,  talked  about  the  specific  philosopher  interests  interest  confessing  Anglicans  .  We're  only  talking  about  you  we  have  to  visit  Myanmar  my  retirement  and  ,  ,  ,  minor  when  .  The  things  that  I've  learned  from  this  and  thing  think  great  Greg  last  with  the  world  .  Things  workings  are  banned  from  infamous  this  more  evermore  is  trust  trusting  in  God  and  one  step  at  a  time  when  we  were  meant  to  get  on  home  phone  .  We  didn't  know  what  would  emerge  from  Capcom  Gaskell  wasn't  planned  .  In  that  sense  now  that  almost  being  been  met  that  .  I  wanted  to  the  play  ,  but  it  wasn't  and  matters  Reagan  over  said  ousted  is  no  now  No  that  .  Sit  down  .  Let's  just  see  how  it  can  work  out  .  Now  ,  once  what's  again  gonna  ,  be  like  in  five  years  years'  time  .  I'm  hoping  that  if  if  it  there  was  were  some  emergency  he  here  where  things  were  not  going  as  they  that  sort  play  audibly  and  made  maybe  it  it's  a  rivalry  .  But  even  if  you're  out  in  the  film  ,  she  would  stand  united  in  and  saying  no  to  sort  of  Christianity  .  We  want  Wallace  was  in  the  Church  of  England  is  not  like  that  ,  it's  got  going  to  be  caught  cost  ,  as  a  were  well  swirl  of  concern  the  ,  but  more  than  that  ,  and  an  in  innocence  innocent  more  exciting  .  I  would  hope  to  see  a  vast  network  worldwide  network  of  Christian  people  in  touch  with  each  other  ,  strengthening  each  other  ,  sharing  ideas  bearing  bear  mine  might  another's  mind  burdens  and  simply  rejoicing  in  the  fact  that  Christ  has  brought  them  together  in  that  that's  sort  of  Anglican  form  of  the  lot  Hillah  line  and  one  thing  we  learned  learn  learning  well  ,  I  hope  people  living  learning  learn  earning  in  this  problem  whole  ,  though  ,  is  that  God  created  the  church's  churches  his  initiative  of  and  his  purposes  .  It  didn't  come  out  of  a  senator  can  come  out  of  the  commission  Commission  .  The  that  people  who  would  were  turned  turn  on  down  and  set  on  fire  file  .  On  that  date  day  and  anti  cost  coast  that  happened  happen  to  them  because  God  planned  it  .  I  think  what  the  West  has  to  understand  is  that  God  does  things  graciously  involving  us  not  because  we've  we  worked  it  all  out  on  a  five  year  plan  and  asked  him  to  put  his  rubber  stamp  on  it  them  because  gold  he's  is  doing  it's  risky  .  It  it's  scared  scary  ,  but  it's  the  way  gold  God  dust  things  and  the  way  Paul  minister  in  the  first  century  is  it's  the  way  Gore  calls  called  us  to  minister  now  .  Today  he's  calling  us  to  step  out  into  an  unknown  future  .  But  unknown  to  us  not  to  him  .  I  tell  the  story  when  I  had  go  to  a  very  difficult  meeting  once  months  there  was  is  a  promise  me  got  down  got  on  my  knees  and  in  my  bedroom  shot  shock  that  and  all  column  on  among  these  massive  ,  Lord  ,  I  really  don't  know  what's  gonna  to  happen  ,  what  I  should  be  doing  and  God  said  to  me  be  break  great  when  I  called  you  did  ,  you  know  ,  it's  what's  gonna  happen  and  well  I  had  to  say  no  don't  disagree  .  Nothing  nothing's  has  changed  ,  and  I  really  believe  that  God  has  called  us  to  an  exciting  ball  war  walk  with  him  .  Sometimes  you  might  have  some  kind  of  idea  what's  going  to  gonna  happen  tomorrow  ,  but  we've  got  to  learn  to  take  those  steps  and  let  then  him  in  use  some  .  I  really  believe  if  we  can  go  without  .  We  have  this  yo  your  year  wonderful  future  Christianity  in  the  world  .  And  to  that  I  say  I  and  then  ,  don't  think  about  your  time  here  .  And  then  give  courage  or  you  do  don't  publicity  publish 
10;614.44;Anglicantv-FCA2009RevRoberts569;eng-usa;11;1017;religion;Watch;['anglicantv']; so  I  can  tell  you  what's  going  to  happen  in  our  nation's  nations  and  the  Anglican  churches  Church  within  them  .  But  I  can  tell  you  the  nightmare  .  I  have  ,  and  the  jury  dream  Tory  ,  depending  on  whether  I'm  feeling  positive  or  negative  .  I  have  one  of  the  other  .  Let's  begin  with  the  a  nightmare  in  my  negative  moments  this  nightmare  seems  seemed  not  only  realistic  .  But  I  have  had  to  say  quite  likely  even  very  likely  light  in  my  nightmare  we  continue  with  the  gradual  drift  towards  the  apostasy  of  the  Episcopal  Church  so  that  in  20  years  ,  maybe  even  10  years  it  becomes  virtually  impossible  for  the  Orthodox  orthodox  to  be  ordained  within  our  churches  ,  either  because  the  hierarchy  simply  will  not  accept  them  all  or  because  those  with  intent  within  integrity  will  feel  unable  to  offer  themselves  coordination  within  such  churches  .  As  a  result  ,  the  gospel  witness  in  the  Anglican  churches  Church  in  these  islands  will  be  gradually  extinguished  with  massive  loss  to  the  cause  which  I  take  it  is  his  all  first  and  foremost  in  our  minds  today  ,  which  is  the  a  vandalized  vandalize  nation  of  our  nations  nation's  and  of  your  Europe  someone  says  ,  well  ,  how  is  it  possible  as  but  such  a  nightmare  to  come  to  be  some  would  say  we've  never  had  it  so  good  .  Rising  to  prominence  within  our  church  Church  of  in  England  ,  and  in  other  churches  as  well  .  Undoubtedly  definitely  ,  good  things  are  happening  .  How  could  it  be  that  this  nightmare  night  becomes  reality  .  Well  ,  a  number  of  things  could  easily  happen  for  a  start  ,  naive  Betty  sea  failing  to  notice  how  serious  the  situation  is  not  least  because  of  the  salami  tactics  of  the  revisionist  slice  by  slice  by  slice  removing  Orthodox  faith  small  little  bits  so  that  you  you're  hardly  see  it  happening  gradually  establishing  facts  on  the  ground  ,  rather  than  bringing  things  to  a  head  when  the  battle  would  be  lost  if  that  was  to  happen  slice  by  slice  by  bye  starts  Stars  naive  .  It  it's  and  compromise  .  Not  getting  engaged  in  the  battle  was  or  well  saying  that  no  we  will  get  engaged  ,  but  not  now  .  Now  is  not  the  time  later  later  later  later  ,  and  of  course  there  there's  is  the  a  cost  costs  course  we  don't  have  to  acknowledge  that  its  this  it's  we  think  of  our  brothers  and  sisters  in  and  other  provinces  being  kicked  out  of  the  their  churches  pensions  removed  salaries  removed  closer  to  home  ,  at  least  in  the  short  term  .  The  cost  will  be  much  milder  than  that  and  yet  we're  we  with  scared  of  over  it  .  But  their  relationship  with  the  bishop  .  We  might  not  get  that  Kiran  cure  curate  we  might  not  be  enthusiastically  supported  supportive  for  that  plant  long  we  might  get  a  reputation  as  a  troublemaker  and  so  profound  becomes  unlikely  a  well  all  major  maybe  winner  when  checks  setting  with  where  the  PCC  would  not  Bacchus  back  and  we'd  much  rather  just  focus  on  the  local  area  and  not  get  involved  compromise  and  then  this  nightmare  night  happens  ,  not  just  because  of  a  naive  ,  witty  Betty  beauty  and  compromise  compromised  .  But  because  of  divisions  within  the  very  people  who  should  stand  firm  and  united  there  are  many  within  our  church  is  committed  to  reveal  site  fight  received  in  cross  trust  from  God  and  Anna  a  convinced  that  we  are  not  at  liberty  to  change  that  truth  true  .  There  are  many  with  deep  concerns  about  the  draft  drift  but  amongst  the  many  we  come  from  different  tribes  evangelical  conservative  conservatives  in  general  will  open  even  gentle  general  charismatic  even  general  General  and  the  danger  is  in  my  nightmare  that  people  will  not  get  involved  in  this  movement  because  but  of  it's  suspicion  as  to  who  else  is  involved  and  the  very  people  who  they  should  be  here  will  be  our  greatest  enemies  the  result  is  if  we're  not  careful  .  But  if  a  you  just  a  very  small  number  from  one  particular  grouping  will  move  forward  .  They'll  disagree  with  each  other  as  to  when  the  time  is  right  to  take  decisive  action  there  be  gradual  defections  Church  of  England  continuing  practice  Reform  Church  of  England  continuing  brackets  Forward  in  Faith  Church  of  England  continuing  brackets  new  wine  ,  you  get  a  kind  of  sectarianism  breaking  out  and  .  Then  ,  of  course  ,  the  Protestant  protestant  disease  kicks  in  .  Once  you've  you  started  dividing  you  divide  over  more  and  more  little  things  and  we're  where  a  succession  of  lots  and  lots  of  groups  with  no  chance  whatsoever  of  reforming  our  denomination  are  our  Church  church  of  England  renewing  it  or  all  reaching  the  nation  just  lots  and  lots  of  little  divided  groups  .  That's  my  nightmare  it  may  be  like  that  it  must  not  be  like  that  but  let  you  tell  tap  .  Let  me  tell  you  my  dream  my  dream  is  for  a  strong  United  united  renewal  movement  of  orthodox  Anglicans  ,  the  in  God  will  use  used  to  stem  the  tide  of  heresy  Paris  in  our  churches  and  the  a  movement  of  mission  for  all  our  the  world  I  believe  that's  just  begun  the  today  and  if  it's  to  work  we  must  .  From  the  very  beginning  ,  be  committed  to  certain  things  a  commitment  for  a  start  to  truth  .  This  must  never  be  a  merely  pragmatic  alliance  a  very  disparate  groups  united  in  and  what  what's  we've  we  with  close  clothes  oppose  closed  rolled  role  and  than  what  we  stand  for  .  We  are  joined  by  a  common  will  Liverpool  face  faith  as  expressed  by  candidate  .  Five  of  the  Church  of  England  and  the  Jerusalem  declaration  .  We  believe  in  the  Bible  God's  word  written  we  proclaim  Jesus  Christ  are  our  only  law  Lord  .  The  only  rule  real  and  the  only  say  a  commitment  to  truth  .  And  yet  it  also  a  commitment  to  break  within  those  who  stand  by  that  .  True  there's  a  great  privilege  to  be  a  Gaskell  and  a  to  witness  yes  great  unity  .  In  truth  ,  and  yet  great  bread  read  red  racially  ,  culturally  liturgical  we  can  can't  be  a  convoy  working  together  .  We  do  have  secondary  secondly  differences  would  with  we  probably  won't  all  be  in  the  same  boat  narrowly  understood  we  we've  ,  as  has  already  been  mentioned  have  different  views  ,  for  instance  ,  on  whether  women  should  be  ordained  or  consecrated  as  bishops  ,  and  there  are  many  other  things  .  What  well  where  we  have  use  views  on  secondary  issues  where  we  differ  we  must  have  raced  towards  one  another  .  As  we  differ  on  secondary  matters  .  That's  it's  my  third  commitment  truth  troops  Bradford  third  commitment  to  grace  Grace  amongst  ourselves  to  be  gracious  .  We  will  not  always  agree  with  each  other  .  We  might  think  .  I  wouldn't  say  said  sound  like  I  that  I  would  would've  have  done  exactly  that  .  The  but  British  stand  together  and  Grace  grace  to  two  too  towards  those  who  are  not  here  those  who  agree  with  us  on  the  fundamentals  but  a  the  largely  permits  pundits  planets  it'll  evil  reasons  do  not  feel  that  they  can  join  us  at  this  stage  .  And  ,  at  times  ,  we  might  find  that  they  will  speak  very  strongly  against  this  us  and  we're  not  responding  car  but  the  to  share  show  grace  Grace  to  them  then  to  keep  the  door  open  and  the  to  pray  pride  that  they  will  would  join  us  .  Truth  true  Brett  Bret  greats  grates  prayer  our  vision  on  are  our  is  to  renew  our  churches  to  reform  them  and  to  reach  the  world  ,  and  that  is  something  we  cannot  do  an  one  hour  we  stand  with  the  vast  majority  of  Anglicans  worldwide  we  come  from  vibrant  churches  .  There  are  a  are  lot  lots  of  us  here  today  .  But  we  dare  not  delude  ourselves  into  thinking  we  are  strong  .  We  are  not  strong  .  We  are  very  weak  worried  .  But  I've  got  a  strong  and  finally  ,  a  commitment  to  action  .  Right  danger  .  Is  it  a  movement  that  not  might  like  this  will  just  descend  send  sand  into  an  organization  with  endless  committee  meetings  .  Lots  of  tall  and  no  action  .  Of  course  ,  we've  got  to  talk  to  one  on  and  in  course  we've  we  gotta  got  take  council  counsel  with  one  another  .  But  we  must  act  resisting  error  era  and  promoting  the  gospel  Gospel  is  if  possible  within  the  structures  if  necessary  ,  on  the  edge  not  to  build  our  own  Glenn  lent  part  Park  but  for  to  the  extension  of  God's  kingdom  and  for  the  glory  of  his  name  .  That  is  my  dream  brothers  and  sisters  .  If  we  work  hard  together  ,  united  in  truth  true  to  the  god  God  guard  who  longs  that  these  nations  would  will  be  vandalized  ,  far  more  than  we  do  and  our  church  reform  ,  then  ,  that  dream  my  shots  a  reality  ,  joining  with  me  ,  please  in  praying  prank  may  May  beast

I  heard  don't  how  many  middle  medals  spot  Scott  school  and  they  are  saying  and  arson  NASA  because  is  as  the  Serious  serious  Man  that  is  going  on  all  over  the  fleas  face  phrase  and  can  damage  people  physically  and  mentally  and  emotionally  .  That's  it  happens  a  lot  .  It's  at  gone  called  .  It  is  very  a  common  .  This  there  is  a  nonstop  stabbed  activity  that  happens  at  any  time  .  It  can  lead  meet  to  decide  ,  he  is  said  ,  to  have  eating  disorders  .  They  that  can  damage  their  bodies  .  People  don't  think  that's  that  spreading  gossip  effectively  deal  ,  but  they're  there  their  on  ,  it  can  cause  problems  in  school  and  at  home  .  Therefore  it  .  It's  not  the  best  thing  to  do  .  It's  is  not  ,  I  can  been  stabbed  stand  stop  does  the  bank  and  in  Charlie  ,  but  I  can  try  to  get  surgeons  children's  attention  and  let  them  know  how  it  can  affect  people  my  name  is  the  and  I  have  had  type  Academy  academy  my  grades  Greece  have  had  been  a  problem  every  everything  since  its  they  it  started  start  eight  straight  ,  I  began  to  get  Cs  C's  and  Ds  D's  .  I  really  didn't  do  as  well  .  My  classes  .  My  migrate  migrates  started  to  go  down  ,  and  so  the  that  my  high  GPA  my  mom  used  to  get  called  at  home  .  Almost  every  day  ,  and  in  even  either  Bill  Taylor  again  I  later  Claire's  Clare's  was  coughing  up  out  now  or  they're  just  into  my  work  ,  I  thought  I  could  get  past  everything  like  I  this  guess  ,  but  it  wasn't  true  .  I  try  to  do  my  way  wear  where  ,  but  I  just  couldn't  and  didn't  understand  MIT  teacher  churches  just  didn't  take  me  seriously  anymore  more  .  I'm  going  to  tell  you  about  the  that  day  they'd  date  that  I  realized  realize  that  I  ISAs  sit  start  taking  things  seriously  .  Many  people  made  me  realize  they  had  to  pull  myself  together  and  began  begin  to  do  good  in  school  or  else  up  that  end  up  like  what  they  they've  dined  up  like  it  was  a  that  they'd  bait  there  their  we  week  go  Grace  from  school  basis  my  sister  so  ,  give  gave  a  us  speech  Peter  ,  manners  and  it  they  quickly  opened  .  There's  their  there  a  Malcolm  smile  up  in  their  face  .  That  man  ,  the  they  be  going  Hoegaarden  go  crazy  .  Then  I  just  sobbed  saw  in  them  right  at  to  the  kitchen  to  show  my  dad  their  grades  .  All  of  a  sudden  I  became  really  nervous  and  happy  because  saying  ,  you  know  that  I  had  have  tried  my  best  .  This  marking  period  Pirie  Puri  .  I  opened  the  letter  slowly  and  then  I  saw  there  ahead  going  car  out  at  two  to  point  O  5  .  I  got  very  disappointed  disappointing  because  then  they  saying  you  knew  then  my  mom  mum  and  in  I  there  were  we're  gonna  going  get  mad  at  me  ,  I  didn't  even  wanted  to  show  them  ,  but  I  had  have  my  mom  yelling  nearing  the  and  N  I've  been  burned  Abendanon  in  an  innocent  arson  saying  yes  to  that's  study  crazy  the  Casianos  Younis  .  That's  when  I  began  to  freak  out  because  saying  you  know  what  they  were  gonna  say  S  SI  I  was  walking  towards  my  mom  money  in  and  their  there  obvious  are  being  feeling  feelings  sent  dusk  Basque  into  my  head  when  they  told  me  there  was  going  to  end  up  .  Many  in  the  pilot  that's  I  think  in  that  guy  I  won  when  my  teachers  were  up  out  and  there  say  ,  I  think  they  that  not  united  even  going  England  to  end  and  of  a  graduating  .  But  the  one  that  day  will  never  get  out  my  here  head  was  when  a  substitute  Tommy  Tony  was  doubtless  cheers  going  to  be  one  more  morning  way  at  the  net  to  end  up  dropping  out  of  school  or  kicked  out  of  school  in  end  a  up  working  in  McDonald's  when  the  substitute  said  this  I  ad  at  in  didn't  and  know  how  to  react  .  Where  what  were  to  set  sit  back  ,  so  I  just  walked  out  of  the  wrong  room  as  a  I  there  was  outside  .  It  just  made  me  realize  a  that  lot  of  things  pain  how  not  to  end  up  how  have  they  want  wanted  to  .  I  just  Selig  like  it  had  no  support  from  anyone  and  tied  tired  me  man  my  now  best  friend  forever  minor  Mina  .  I  tell  her  everything  at  I  Chester  trust  and  we  bought  ours  now  hours  out  making  kills  like  ,  for  example  ,  we  always  we  say  see  after  there  every  marking  period  there  they're  great  and  not  so  good  now  for  real  .  We're  we  going  to  do  good  this  semester  .  Well  ,  they  will  try  but  we  bowled  both  believing  each  other  ,  and  now  how  we  can  do  it  .  I  think  that  there  will  be  fewer  dropouts  dropout  it's  it  at  least  one  person  believes  that  you  can  make  it  all  the  way  ,  because  it's  not  people  would  just  put  a  lot  of  stereotypes  going  to  you  and  know  just  because  you  were  weren't  there  is  no  you  don't  wind  when  up  it  like  that  love  black  blah  love  lava  .  That's  up  to  you  to  prove  them  wrong  .  violence  is  a  big  thing  as  this  well  .  Well  ,  as  King  king  can  had  have  been  done  when  you  lose  expected  growing  going  up  industries  ministries  of  Oakland  you  when  win  this  there's  a  lot  allow  of  violence  ,  whether  it's  happening  having  to  you  ,  we're  really  dying  don  .  The  violence  as  a  young  ,  so  you  have  to  watch  what  you  do  in  and  whom  you  hang  have  with  .  You  have  to  be  careful  what  colors  color  aware  how  much  over  further  you  wear  where  the  time  that  amateur  you're  more  interested  join  gangs  .  The  summit  a  school  score  until  to  late  0  sometimes  people  use  violence  to  either  hide  Sen  is  because  of  the  a  family  problems  they  have  at  home  ,  says  so  her  a  the  family  doesn't  want  to  help  them  out  ,  they  turn  turned  to  the  streets  again  ,  we'll  will  take  you  and  protect  you  .  Sometimes  you  can  make  more  money  than  both  of  your  parents  repairs  make  in  a  week  in  and  one  day  .  No  nowhere  person  can  make  money  is  by  selling  drugs  again  getting  paid  to  shoot  someone  who  really  need  the  money  .  Of  course  you  choose  the  streets  or  so  of  only  your  family  any  day  and  that's  one  where  more  set  sort  of  parents  ,  glad  black  by  to  see  most  of  the  time  ,  especially  now  that  everyone  wants  to  lead  let  his  clothes  close  .  The  latest  relays  phone  fine  .

Esta  Ésta  es  la  historia  de  Gustavo  Gustav  gustar  gustado  El  el  3  de  enero  del  2008  Nunca  nunca  lo  no  podré  olvidar  y  Y  parece  pareja  yo  ello  tuvimos  Tuvimos  una  pequeña  discusión  su  Su  enojo  fue  tanto  que  no  lo  le  llegó  llevó  al  el  punto  de  golpear  me  llame  a  la  policía  Policía  .  Pues  Pues  sí  si  estaba  incontrolable  ,  fue  Fue  arrestada  por  violencia  doméstica  .  Y  y  .  Así  comenzó  todo  toda  esta  pesadilla  Ella  ella  regresó  el  viernes  siguiente  .  En  y  el  transcurso  de  los  días  la  La  situación  se  fue  empeorando  .  Mi  Mi  mujer  por  ganar  la  custodia  de  mi  hijo  me  le  acusó  de  los  peores  cargos  que  para  un  hombre  Posteriormente  posteriormente  Fui  fui  fue  a  diferentes  lugares  a  buscar  ayuda  para  hombres  víctimas  de  violencia  doméstica  ,  pero  Pero  no  encontré  nada  Sólo  solo  sólo  Solo  Marisela  Maricela  de  casa  Casa  Ella  ella  yo  me  puedo  referir  a  un  curso  para  víctimas  de  violencia  doméstica  Me  me  arrestaron  rezaron  el  11  de  febrero  por  cargos  de  abuso  sexual  e  intento  de  homicidio  y  Y  ese  contacto  con  la  organización  local  de  ayuda  ayudas  para  mujeres  acusadas  ,  quienes  le  dieron  Asesoría  asesoría  y  Apoyo  apoyo  sin  comprobar  si  lo  que  ella  decía  era  verdad  o  sólo  solo  se  aprovechaba  de  los  recursos  Mientras  mientras  tanto  la  Corte  corte  sólo  medio  más  tiempo  para  revisar  mi  caso  me  puso  puse  una  fianza  ,  la  cual  no  podía  pagar  pues  me  re  red  r  Red  tendrían  por  mi  estado  migratorio  hasta  comprobar  mi  inocencia  Ella  ella  se  presentó  en  corte  Corte  y  reafirmó  que  todos  los  cargos  eran  ciertos  .  Y  y  yo  me  preguntaba  por  qué  lo  hacía  donde  dónde  quedó  mi  mil  muy  reporte  policial  Acaso  acaso  Acasuso  eso  no  tenía  importancia  hacer  Hacer  mi  denuncia  sólo  sirvió  para  terminar  yo  hecho  como  pensador  acusador  boxeador  y  estar  en  prisión  Todo  todo  fue  en  vano  .  Para  mi  defensa  y  Y  ya  a  la  misma  vez  se  presentó  a  al  corte  acorte  Corte  civil  Civil  apoyada  por  otra  organización  del  Gobierno  para  solicitar  la  custodia  del  niño  ,  donde  es  suficiente  ser  yo  ilegal  legal  para  quitarme  todos  los  derechos  sobre  mi  hijo  Nadie  nadie  da  del  crédito  a  las  palabras  de  alguien  que  está  preso  en  la  Corte  .  Me  dieron  fecha  fechas  para  comenzar  mi  juicio  el  El  fiscal  Fiscal  me  ha  ofrecido  un  cargo  menor  por  no  tener  suficientes  pruebas  en  mi  contra  De  todos  modos  tengo  que  ser  culpable  de  algo  No  no  puedo  salir  inocente  me  Me  encuentro  cumpliendo  una  sentencia  de  nueve  meses  .  Pero  Pero  si  decido  ir  a  juicio  para  demostrar  mi  inocencia  corre  Corro  corro  el  riesgo  de  que  no  me  crea  por  Por  la  presión  que  ejerce  la  presidencia  de  esta  organización  de  mujeres  y  Y  me  den  una  condena  de  hasta  30  años  cuando  salga  ,  voy  a  ser  deportado  y  Y  tendría  tendré  un  tiempo  de  libertad  condicional  de  5  años  donde  Donde  no  podré  ver  a  mi  hijo  y  no  devolver  volver  al  país  a  un  una  aquí  cumpliendo  mi  sentencia  Ella  ella  sigue  poniendo  me  Me  más  cargos  con  la  intención  de  que  me  den  más  tiempo  de  cárcel  y  Y  quedado  marcado  de  por  vida  exterior  e  interiormente  y  más  habiendo  tantos  casos  similares  ,  aquí  dentro  .  Por  los  mismos  cargos  buscar  ayuda  fue  estresante  y  doloroso  vivirlo  todo  Todo  me  fue  negado  por  qué  porque  Acaso  por  ser  hombre  no  sufro  porque  por  no  podemos  ser  nosotros  los  maltratados  El  el  no  saber  reconocer  una  relación  violenta  lleva  Lleva  a  sufrir  a  niños  y  familias  es  Es  bastante  el  daño  que  causó  causa  una  persona  guiada  por  el  orgullo  y  la  venganza  Por  por  esto  yo  quisiera  que  mi  caso  ayude  a  mantener  a  otras  personas  unidas  fuera  Fuera  de  esta  violencia  Me  me  daría  mucha  paz  saber  Saber  que  mi  sufrir  en  este  lugar  se  sea  ha  utilizado  para  un  bien  espero  Espero  pero  Dios  me  ayude  a  soportar  esta  sentencia  y  Y  volver  a  mis  seres  queridos  Mis  mis  oraciones  a  todos  aquellos  que  están  pasando  por  lo  mismo  ,  pues  no  se  para  de  sufrir  aquí  .  Pero  pero  todo  esto  podría  haber  tenido  más  igualdad  Si  si  el  sistema  no  estuviera  hubiera  inclinado  inclinada  hacia  un  solo  lado  si  Si  existieran  existiera  más  mas  ayudas  ayuda  para  hombres  víctimas  víctima  de  violencia  doméstica  y  en  él  tuviera  que  un  estatus  legal  .

Today's  topic  alternative  fuels  come  back  comeback  .  The  alternative  energy  sector  took  a  major  hit  over  the  past  year  ,  as  oil  prices  dropped  and  a  shore  side  investors  momentarily  forgot  forgotten  about  the  energy  crisis  now  .  Oil  prices  are  shooting  back  up  and  gas  prices  are  actually  increasing  any  faster  pace  .  This  makes  alternative  energy  solutions  more  viable  for  the  immediate  future  .  These  alternatives  ,  go  far  beyond  simple  gas  electric  hybrid  vehicles  advanced  biofuels  solar  and  wind  energy  devices  and  other  technologies  are  leading  the  way  toward  entering  the  market  and  freeing  themselves  from  government  subsidies  .  Biofuels  are  slowly  moving  away  from  corn  based  ethanol  ,  which  is  not  a  viable  long  term  solution  and  toward  better  products  like  cellulosic  wind  and  solar  power  generation  is  becoming  cheaper  and  easier  to  manage  .  But  they  still  depend  heavily  on  tax  credits  ,  though  they're  not  yet  capable  of  competing  directly  with  gas  ,  oil  and  coal  increased  competition  among  alternative  energy  sectors  will  produce  strong  candidates  .  One  of  the  strongest  candidates  for  the  future  is  not  even  a  true  alternative  but  rather  in  a  next  generation  version  of  an  old  technology  ,  nuclear  power  ,  promises  more  energy  output  than  any  other  known  method  of  generating  electricity  ,  and  it  does  so  while  producing  no  error  air  ground  or  water  pollution  .  The  only  instances  of  pollution  are  the  result  of  major  mistakes  .  They  are  the  exception  ,  not  the  rule  .  The  bottom  line  is  that  the  United  States  needs  to  break  itself  of  its  addiction  to  oil  .  Our  use  of  oil  is  not  only  harmful  to  our  environment  ,  but  also  to  our  economy  .  It  sends  hundreds  of  billions  of  dollars  overseas  too  often  hostile  governments  and  it  that  leads  to  political  instability  and  inequality  in  many  of  the  oil  producing  countries  an  and  alternative  energy  future  ,  it  would  absolve  the  US  and  its  it's  costly  commitments  to  the  Middle  East  and  help  this  country  become  an  energy  leader  once  again  a  boom  in  the  alternative  energy  sector  would  create  perhaps  hundreds  of  thousands  of  permanent  ,  stable  jobs  for  America's  skilled  workforce  and  it  would  allow  the  economy  to  expand  and  grow  without  the  specter  of  foreign  oil  or  polluting  coal  on  behalf  of  concerned  citizens  .

Today's  topic  America's  Americas  routes  roots  the  United  States  has  fallen  far  from  its  position  of  global  economic  dominance  .  Once  a  superpower  the  United  States  is  now  nothing  more  than  a  debt  sodden  shell  of  its  former  self  .  The  nation  which  we  built  the  world  after  two  world  wars  ,  which  pioneered  much  of  the  technological  advance  of  on  the  20th  and  20  centuries  which  created  the  modern  war  economy  is  now  not  flat  on  its  face  .

The  US  has  little  left  to  offer  for  the  rest  of  the  world  economist  Peter  Murray  Marie  C  Sea  see  believes  he  may  have  found  a  solution  .  The  US  needs  to  return  to  its  roots  .  An  in  article  written  for  The  Atlanta  Journal  Constitution  Marie  Murray  C  Sea  see  explains  the  need  for  America  to  focus  on  creating  jobs  and  productive  facilities  in  and  industries  manufacturing  was  and  always  has  been  the  backbone  of  economic  growth  and  stability  .  But  the  US  abandoned  its  industrial  heartland  for  the  lavish  as  is  of  Wall  Street  meanwhile  nations  like  China  are  more  than  willing  to  pick  up  the  slack  and  use  their  new  news  facilities  as  a  means  of  creating  jobs  ,  wealth  and  any  in  middle  class  ,  which  will  drive  their  economy  for  generations  to  come  .  Marie  breezy  Maurice  believes  that  the  US  must  adopt  policies  which  encourage  Americans  to  study  engineering  ,  math  maths  sciences  and  other  trades  ,  which  produce  produced  wealth  as  well  as  innovation  .  This  was  the  policy  ,  which  turned  turn  the  United  States  into  a  global  power  .

Today's  topic  its  is  it  solution  to  the  trade  deficit  the  United  States  is  scrambling  for  solutions  to  its  combined  trade  and  budget  deficits  .  Unfortunately  ,  we  have  thus  far  failed  to  address  these  problems  ,  and  some  of  our  policies  have  done  nothing  more  than  making  things  worse  .  If  we  want  ever  rid  ourselves  of  this  new  economic  depression  .  We  need  to  look  toward  what  has  worked  in  the  past  ,  many  experts  ,  scholars  and  analysts  have  pointed  out  the  fact  that  during  the  19  ,  the  US  recovered  from  its  worst  depression  in  history  by  protecting  its  economy  to  some  degree  the  protections  and  at  our  government  created  went  a  bit  too  far  and  they've  they  actually  damaged  the  economy  overall  .  However  ,  the  end  result  was  an  economy  which  emerged  from  its  hibernation  stronger  than  ever  .  Trade  reform  dot  org  has  pointed  out  that  during  the  19  .  The  US  did  not  pursue  international  trade  in  anyway  any  ,  similar  to  the  modern  world  .  They  did  not  have  free  trade  but  instead  had  highly  protected  and  regulated  national  economy  .  If  we  were  to  champion  the  sort  of  economic  nationalization  of  the  19  we  can  could  build  up  protections  to  ensure  our  economic  survival  into  the  future  .  Obviously  the  United  States  cannot  afford  the  ice  iced  isolationist  strategies  employed  decades  ago  .  Our  economy  is  too  important  to  be  to  two  international  trade  and  international  trade  is  too  important  to  our  economy  to  ever  break  the  that  you  two  chill  of  one  another  .  Instead  ,  what  we  must  do  is  create  a  regulated  relationship  between  international  International  trade  and  the  US  economy  right  now  .  The  US  is  has  one  of  the  least  regulated  economies  in  the  world  we  open  our  borders  to  all  comers  ,  and  as  a  result  ,  we've  seen  cheap  goods  come  in  while  well  paying  jobs  go  out  .  Americans  have  seen  jobs  and  livelihoods  go  overseas  and  those  losses  must  be  regained  for  any  recovery  .  To  have  a  chance  .  The  US  must  once  again  look  looked  toward  court  protective  tariffs  ,  import  quotas  and  national  National  job  programs  if  it  helps  hopes  to  invigorate  its  economy  without  peace  these  without  these  things  .  There  may  be  no  help  hope  our  economy  has  proven  over  the  past  four  decades  .  The  increasing  economic  liberalization  does  not  work  in  our  international  system  we  we've  we're  simply  watched  her  our  annual  endure  trade  deficits  deficit  balloon  ,  year  after  year  .

Today's  topic  following  US  tax  revenue  revenues  the  American  Institute  for  Economic  Research  an  independent  group  focused  focus  on  education  and  policy  evaluation  released  a  report  on  May  twenty  sixth  stating  seed  that  federal  income  tax  receipts  fell  34  percent  versus  .  Last  year  ,  federal  tax  revenue  decreased  decrease  by  one  hundred  and  thirty  eight  billion  dollars  from  its  level  in  2008  .  Kerry  Carrie  Lynch  Lynch's  ,  senior  analyst  at  the  Institute  .  In  an  interview  with  USA  Today  said  that  this  illustrates  how  severe  the  recession  has  been  this  they  should  not  be  surprising  ,  considering  that  the  American  economy  shed  more  than  six  million  jobs  from  for  through  April  2008  April  2009  ,  when  one  fewer  people  have  jobs  they  bring  in  less  income  and  therefore  have  had  less  taxable  income  in  a  time  when  federal  budget  deficits  are  growing  such  massive  losses  in  tax  revenue  could  become  a  huge  calamity  .  The  US  government  currently  operates  with  within  the  national  debt  well  beyond  11  trillion  dollars  the  Congressional  Budget  Office  projects  a  shortfall  in  2009  .  Of  1.7  trillion  for  that  year  alone  .  If  we  accept  the  White  House's  deficit  projections  for  the  next  four  years  .  Our  national  debt  will  top  out  at  over  14  trillion  .  By  2013  .  There  is  no  way  to  pay  down  this  its  rapidly  accumulating  debt  it's  if  it  IRS  receipts  are  declining  from  year  to  year  .  Last  year  ,  the  IRS  took  in  approximately  four  hundred  and  five  billion  dollars  .  That  means  that  in  order  to  pay  off  our  national  debt  ,  the  government  would  have  to  spend  every  penny  of  its  income  from  tax  revenue  for  nearly  three  years  solely  on  paying  down  2000  and  9  .  Its  budget  deficit  .  There'll  be  no  funding  for  military  education  ,  health  care  or  other  programs  .  It  would  take  approximately  25  years  to  pay  down  the  national  debt  .  If  that  taxable  revenue  dwindles  .  The  timeline  becomes  prolonged  indefinitely  the  United  States  must  find  ways  to  start  making  money  again  .  The  income  tax  ,  instituted  in  32  is  controversial  in  many  sectors  ,  but  there's  no  denying  the  amount  of  money  it  raises  races  the  Democrats  and  Republicans  constantly  offering  offer  lower  taxes  ,  but  they  do  so  while  ignoring  the  fact  that  those  taxes  pay  for  the  government's  operations  .  We  have  two  choices  we  can  raise  the  money  ourselves  to  through  taxation  or  all  we  can  borrow  it  from  overseas  borrowing  borrowings  from  overseas  was  the  Bush  administration's  agenda  and  it  makes  our  government  governments  susceptible  to  pressures  from  foreign  governments  .  It's  therefore  not  a  very  good  solution  .  We  need  to  raise  money  domestically  .  Our  government  must  re  institute  Institute  import  tariffs  on  the  trillions  of  dollars  worth  of  goods  flowing  into  this  country  .  It  then  needs  to  reinvest  that  money  into  domestic  economic  initiatives  to  provide  jobs  and  ,  finally  ,  the  government  must  come  to  its  senses  and  stop  stopped  lowering  taxes  .

The  article  claims  that  the  US  is  recovering  recovery  ,  and  in  fact  responding  faster  than  lagging  economies  of  Europe  .  The  premise  of  the  article  surrounds  projections  ,  which  show  the  European  economy  contracted  4.2  percent  .  This  year  ,  compared  to  2.8  percent  in  the  US  the  New  York  Times  cited  private  economists  for  its  projections  ,  and  it  he  they  did  not  release  where  weather  data  was  gathered  .  But  even  if  the  data  is  accurate  ,  it  does  not  show  recovery  .  What  the  data  shows  is  it's  a  slightly  lower  rate  of  decline  .  Considering  the  fact  that  the  euro  is  a  stronger  currency  than  the  dollar  and  that  the  EU  is  a  larger  economy  than  the  United  States  .  It  seems  reasonable  to  think  that  the  decline  in  the  US  will  hurt  as  much  if  not  more  ,  as  has  any  declines  .

But  there  is  now  simply  too  much  contradictory  every  ever  evidence  to  ignore  .  According  to  the  World  Bank  perhaps  the  leading  authority  on  the  global  economy  .  We  should  expect  a  the  worldwide  downturn  of  roughly  3  percent  in  2009  .  The  forecast  for  the  US  might  mean  be  much  worse  .  The  American  economy  shrank  by  over  6  percent  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2008  and  by  nearly  as  much  in  the  first  quarter  of  2009  .  According  to  the  Bureau  of  Labor  Statistics  unemployment  is  still  rising  at  a  rate  of  over  10000  per  day  and  aimed  the  nationwide  Nationwide  rate  of  unemployment  now  stands  at  9.4  percent  foreclosures  are  still  increasing  wages  are  still  stagnant  staying  .  The  increasing  cost  of  oil  is  driving  up  the  price  of  consumer  goods  and  even  the  most  optimistic  government  and  private  projections  forecast  little  recovery  or  even  stabilization  in  the  US  for  at  least  several  more  months  .

Far  too  many  media  and  government  outlets  have  already  begun  to  claim  that  the  downturn  is  over  .

The  only  countries  which  of  actually  found  benefit  benefits  and  in  growth  during  this  downturn  our  are  China  ,  India  ,  and  a  few  other  developing  countries  ,  which  focused  heavily  on  manufacturing  .  Even  in  those  cases  ,  the  growth  .  It's  is  not  optimal  ,  though  it  is  still  obviously  preferable  to  contraction  what  Brown  fears  is  as  a  so  called  W  shaped  recession  .  His  fear  fears  is  shared  with  famed  NYU  economist  Neary  Nyeri  over  Beanie  ,  who  predicted  the  financial  downturn  .  More  than  two  years  ago  in  such  a  W  shaped  recession  all  indicators  show  a  he  pronounced  and  rapid  economic  decline  ,  followed  by  a  short  recovery  period  .  And  yet  another  period  of  decline  .  When  the  economy  finally  bottoms  out  for  the  second  time  .  It  is  in  worse  shape  than  it  was  previously  after  a  cataclysmic  upheaval  of  the  global  trade  in  and  financial  system  in  the  past  year  .

But  that  is  precisely  the  problem  faced  face  today  the  United  States  which  will  have  representation  at  the  upcoming  G8  summit  would  be  wise  to  take  heed  of  Prime  Minister  Brown's  advice  and  take  prompt  action  to  alter  its  economic  course  during  the  last  global  meeting  of  the  minds  the  G  20  summit  in  London  last  April  President  Obama  firmly  planted  the  American  flag  on  a  policy  of  maintaining  the  old  facade  .

In  his  ruling  ,  also  took  into  account  the  hundreds  of  objectors  object  concerns  .  Most  prominent  among  these  being  the  fear  that  investors  would  be  wiped  out  .  In  his  final  95  page  report  Judge  Gerber  clearly  expressed  his  preference  of  bankruptcy  over  complete  liquidation  Gerber  ,  except  accepted  in  the  bankruptcy  plan  ,  which  puts  60  percent  of  the  new  General  Motors  into  public  hands  .  The  Canadian  government  the  United  Auto  Workers  union  Union  and  certain  bondholders  will  control  the  remaining  40  percent  .  Also  as  part  of  its  cost  saving  measures  the  United  Auto  Workers  union  Union  has  agreed  to  reduce  benefits  for  nearly  600  and  50000  GM  retirees  .  The  entire  reason  for  the  bankruptcy  proceedings  is  to  conserve  at  least  some  of  the  company's  value  if  it  there  they  were  forced  to  go  through  to  outright  liquidation  .  The  results  would  will  be  not  only  the  destruction  of  shareholder  value  but  also  up  ,  but  also  of  creditor  holdings  hoardings  and  unsecured  debts  General  Motors  is  pushing  hard  to  rebuild  its  image  and  has  recently  launched  GM  reinvention  dot  com  as  its  poster  to  the  American  people  .

In  a  highly  publicized  event  and  the  watchful  eyes  of  the  public  and  the  government  are  now  2  too  to  any  new  developments  .  The  biggest  problem  facing  General  Motors  and  all  of  other  the  domestic  car  manufacturers  is  their  inability  to  compete  internationally  .  Chrysler  was  the  first  to  go  under  and  GM  was  quick  to  follow  .  Ford  is  still  solvent  .

The  Japanese  and  European  giants  growing  in  and  their  American  and  international  markets  .  GM  has  to  contend  with  many  obstacles  in  any  comeback  it  must  find  a  way  to  rebuild  its  business  model  to  find  something  profitable  and  sustainable  ,  it  must  build  vehicles  which  American  and  international  consumers  want  to  purchase  it  must  somehow  make  up  the  technological  gap  in  facilities  and  products  which  exists  exist  between  US  automakers  makers  and  their  rivals  overseas  .

Today's  topic  potential  solutions  .  The  Obama  administration  has  taken  a  lot  of  heat  in  the  media  recently  for  failing  to  address  the  free  fall  freefall  of  the  American  economy  congressional  Republicans  are  calling  for  an  end  to  the  stimulus  package  .  They  claim  that  it  has  failed  to  produce  results  and  that  the  too  two  little  of  the  money  is  going  to  the  American  people  .  They  want  to  stop  the  process  now  before  any  more  time  and  money  is  wasted  and  in  turn  instead  toward  towards  tried  and  true  tax  decreases  for  businesses  and  individuals  .  At  the  same  time  congressional  Democrats  are  calling  for  patience  .  Amid  the  economic  storm  .  Less  than  10  percent  of  the  stimulus  money  has  even  gone  out  and  the  President's  stimulus  program  was  intended  to  encompass  the  it  full  for  two  years  it  has  yet  been  just  four  months  .  Even  with  the  growing  arguments  over  health  care  reform  ,  economic  stimulus  ,  taxation  and  other  things  which  are  trumpeted  at  as  solutions  ,  one  thing  remains  clear  .  The  Washington  circle  Circle  is  not  doing  enough  for  Senator  Ernest  Hollings  ,  a  Democrat  from  South  Carolina  ,  argues  that  the  mediocrity  which  our  government  is  mired  in  stems  directly  from  its  very  organization  organizations  every  elected  official  is  constantly  on  the  campaign  .  They  need  to  sound  like  they're  making  progress  so  their  they're  massive  constituents  will  turnout  out  at  the  polls  .  At  the  same  time  ,  they  need  to  cater  to  the  interests  of  the  wealthy  contributors  who  donate  money  and  allow  them  to  seek  office  .  All  of  this  result  in  a  government  quagmire  and  this  more  than  anything  else  is  standing  in  the  way  of  progress  reform  and  recovery  during  the  campaign  .  The  Obama  team  said  everything  it  had  to  ,  in  order  to  collect  votes  .  Once  in  office  ,  it  is  doing  everything  it  has  to  ,  in  order  to  keep  big  business  interests  happy  .  This  is  the  reason  there  there's  has  been  no  progress  on  key  issues  surrounding  international  trade  Hollings  believes  that  the  United  States  could  wipe  away  its  trade  deficit  troubles  with  a  simple  and  comparatively  small  value  added  tax  of  3  to  5  percent  if  we  put  the  a  value  added  tax  ,  like  every  other  country  ,  we  would  still  have  the  most  prosperous  consumer  market  in  the  world  .  It  would  not  result  in  the  dreaded  trade  war  that  the  Congress  and  the  White  House  fear  as  as  Hollings  puts  it  ,  we  are  already  arty  a  wall  AWOL  in  a  trade  war  in  it  value  added  tax  would  not  instigate  anything  it  would  just  mean  that  we  now  have  our  heads  in  the  game  ,  a  value  added  consumption  consumption  scheme  would  absolutely  help  the  government  find  its  federal  deficit  ,  while  also  making  foreign  goods  more  expensive  and  increasingly  impetus  to  produce  produced  domestically  as  a  result  ,  the  budget  and  trade  deficits  would  with  slowly  wind  away  into  surpluses  that  this  nation  desperately  needs  .

The  US  dollar  has  long  been  the  world's  reserve  currency  but  the  absolute  years  Ponce  spots  bounce  ability  of  the  American  government  and  people  has  undermined  its  strength  .

At  the  same  time  ,  they  have  to  continually  printing  print  new  money  to  replace  that  lost  international  trade  in  general  .  The  world  has  become  flooded  with  dollars  this  decreases  their  value  and  makes  holders  quarters  less  willing  to  invest  further  in  an  ever  depreciating  store  of  value  calls  to  replace  the  dollar  as  a  worldwide  reserve  Reserve  have  come  from  China  ,  Russia  and  the  European  Union  even  OPEC  old  if  the  dollar  is  replaced  the  entire  commodity  scheme  which  it  props  up  will  collapse  .

Would a second do any better?;['obama', 'congress']; Hello  and  welcome  to  your  daily  news  and  information  up  update  .  Today's  topic  the  stimulus  package  .  The  original  700  and  87  billion  dollar  economic  stimulus  package  passed  through  Congress  but  was  were  shrouded  by  controversy  and  political  infighting  .  Somehow  the  United  States  States'  government  managed  to  put  together  and  agree  on  a  piece  of  legislation  which  no  one  in  that  government  could  really  agree  on  now  .  Not  surprisingly  ,  the  stimulus  package  is  back  in  the  headlines  Republicans  and  Democrats  are  looking  for  something  new  and  different  as  economic  indicators  continue  to  get  worse  and  the  ineffectiveness  of  the  first  package  becomes  apparent  .  Either  we  need  to  change  the  way  the  money  has  been  appropriated  or  we  need  to  re  write  rewrite  the  bill  altogether  Vice  President  Joe  Biden  on  this  week  with  George  Stephanopoulos  acknowledge  that  the  Obama  team  misread  this  a  very  of  America's  economic  turmoil  .  He  also  acknowledge  acknowledged  the  fact  that  the  stimulus  is  not  stimulating  the  way  it  should  the  Bureau  of  Labor  Statistics  calculated  national  unemployment  at  9.5  percent  in  June  of  2009  .  All  told  ,  roughly  14.7  million  Americans  are  out  of  work  and  half  of  for  the  unemployed  have  come  since  the  recession  began  in  December  of  2007  .  The  president  and  his  office  ,  campaigned  campaign  on  a  platform  to  create  or  save  three  to  four  million  American  jobs  over  the  next  four  years  .  Yet  ,  at  this  rate  the  economy  will  shed  more  than  that  in  2000  and  nine  alone  .  The  only  reason  .  The  job  losses  are  marginally  slowing  is  because  there  are  so  few  places  left  for  employers  to  make  any  cuts  in  the  face  of  this  is  what  one  I'm  of  in  the  face  of  this  dilemma  .  We  have  a  700  and  87  billion  dollar  stimulus  package  that  money  is  largely  sitting  unused  ,  according  to  some  government  estimates  only  10  percent  has  is  gone  out  and  Americans  want  answers  few  Democrats  are  ready  to  call  for  a  new  package  .  But  many  Republicans  relying  on  their  outdated  Reaganomics  .  Mindset  are  already  calling  for  a  new  package  with  more  tax  cuts  .  The  last  eight  years  ,  and  made  it  abundantly  clear  that  the  United  States  needs  more  taxes  rather  than  fewer  .  But  the  Republicans  have  few  solutions  beyond  that  .  Meanwhile  ,  the  Democrats  are  uneasy  about  making  adjustments  so  or  early  in  the  process  ,  and  they  dare  not  ask  pass  passed  another  major  spending  program  programs  in  the  face  of  public  debts  grew  what  this  nation  needs  is  a  fundamental  jobs  program  .  We  absolutely  must  employ  Americans  and  get  money  back  into  the  system  .  We  need  to  put  America  back  to  work  ,  producing  things  which  can  then  be  bought  and  sold  in  domestic  and  international  markets  .  The  old  adage  that  you  have  to  spend  money  to  make  money  is  it's  true  today  than  ever  before  fixing  America  will  be  costly  ,  unless  the  stimulus  starts  flowing  soon  and  starts  flowing  into  projects  that  are  actually  useful  this  entire  episode  will  appear  to  be  nothing  more  than  a  waste  of  time  on  behalf  of  concerned  citizens  .

The  economy  may  be  in  even  worse  shape  than  some  naysayers  have  predicted  every  American  is  well  aware  of  the  rampant  red  job  loss  in  the  United  States  in  June  ,  the  Bureau  of  Labor  Statistics  reported  that  it  in  that  employment  fell  by  an  additional  four  hundred  and  sixty  seven  thousand  bringing  recession  driven  unemployment  to  a  total  of  7.2  million  since  December  2007  ,  however  ,  that  statistic  is  not  even  the  worst  indicator  of  our  economic  decline  columnist  Mortimer  Zuckerman  ,  predicts  that  the  unemployment  numbers  for  June  will  be  adjusted  up  by  40  to  50  percent  in  coming  months  .  When  the  government  auditors  reassess  their  numbers  that  would  place  placed  June  unemployment  implement  implementing  a  the  range  of  six  hundred  thousand  or  more  .  Such  a  rise  would  mean  this  economy  is  back  to  the  break  brake  that  collapse  of  a  few  months  ago  .  Furthermore  ,  Zuckerman  calculates  that  overall  job  losses  since  the  beginning  of  the  recession  now  exceed  the  job  creation  of  the  previous  five  years  .  In  essence  ,  this  downturn  has  destroyed  all  of  the  growth  built  up  since  the  dotcom  com  bubble  in  2000  and  2001  settlement  assessment  is  the  that  actual  unemployment  when  all  workers  were  accounted  for  ,  not  just  those  qualifying  for  government  survey  is  in  the  range  of  16.5  percent  .  This  is  far  higher  than  reported  9.5  percent  published  by  the  government  in  June  .  John  Williams  Shanna  China  steps  that  time  incorporates  incorporating  even  more  data  in  into  his  own  assessments  in  and  places  place  ,  unemployment  at  over  20  percent  in  June  2000  and  9  .  Perhaps  the  most  startling  of  this  of  the  this  statistics  accumulated  by  Zuckerman  is  data  showing  that  the  average  length  of  unemployment  has  reached  twenty  four  and  a  half  weeks  the  highest  total  toll  in  recorded  history  dating  to  67  .  The  number  of  long  term  unemployed  those  who've  been  out  of  work  for  27  weeks  or  more  is  also  at  an  all  time  high  of  4.4  million  even  if  the  stock  market  decline  seems  to  have  bottomed  out  ,  and  the  big  banks  are  now  seeing  a  return  to  their  massive  profitability  .

It's  a  gust  a  of  month  as  we  know  the  Greens  Green's  greens  there  error  are  very  fast  and  sloping  most  of  my  students  get  did  very  mechanical  as  they  part  packed  park  .  And  when  they  get  on  fast  ,  sloping  greens  .  They  have  no  chance  .  And  they're  always  see  all  old  Cabinet  cabinet  cat  sure  nature  my  putter  is  back  and  forth  good  dead  and  they  lose  sense  said  of  the  actual  feel  and  the  line  of  the  pact  putt  .  So  today  ,  and  to  we  he  give  gives  you  three  tips  to  help  you  had  have  better  line  and  better  speed  .  The  first  one  has  to  do  with  it  looking  at  the  whole  while  we  pack  packed  so  often  everybody's  everybody  concerned  about  their  past  power  and  in  their  club  face  faced  that  they  forget  about  were  where  the  target  .  It's  is  so  simple  drill  is  actually  look  at  the  whole  hole  while  we  packed  it's  simple  hand  eye  coordination  .  I  look  at  it  ,  keep  my  eyes  out  at  it  and  I  anti  stroke  I'm  not  looking  down  at  my  powder  putter  Potter  had  seen  where  it's  it  wobbling  or  it's  on  power  .  I'm  just  looking  at  my  target  number  two  is  a  great  visualization  exercise  where  were  we  actually  not  only  see  the  line  of  the  part  pot  but  we  see  it  at  the  speed  it's  going  well  ,  as  we  know  ,  we  first  made  contact  .  It's  going  to  accelerate  then  it's  gonna  plateau  Plateau  and  it's  finally  going  to  die  dye  ,  into  the  hall  hole  .  Now  I'm  on  getting  more  specific  with  where  is  it  .  Entering  the  hall  well  in  this  case  I  have  to  play  it  .  Several  feet  to  the  right  and  I  utilize  my  eyes  and  an  eight  I  track  the  line  wine  I  see  where  it  taxes  Apex  and  then  inward  where  thoughts  I  set  my  stance  accordingly  .  I  now  again  clear  on  that  visualization  of  how  their  that  balls  ball's  moving  I  bring  it  back  and  then  I  stroke  if  it  house  House  may  me  not  only  did  get  the  line  ,  but  now  it  taps  more  back  into  the  speed  in  the  field  feel  .  And  finally  we  get  on  fast  greens  is  the  ability  to  have  the  feel  for  it  .  So  what  lot  at  of  times  were  war  very  mechanical  people  get  very  tight  and  I  want  people  to  get  away  from  that  and  get  into  the  feel  of  the  actual  contact  with  the  putter  powder  face  and  the  ball  so  the  next  drill  has  to  do  with  keeping  your  eyes  closed  .  Why  while  you  part  pat  Pat  stroking  the  pie  part  pipe  in  feeling  .  Did  you  hit  it  short  just  right  write  or  too  far  so  I  get  myself  set  up  close  closed  my  eyes  stroke  stroked  the  pot  now  that  felt  maybe  a  little  too  far  .  Actual  AXA  action  one  in  all  right  ,  but  what  I  was  doing  as  I  was  feeling  the  ball  come  off  the  face  .  It's  interesting  that  the  third  pot  which  my  eyes  were  closed  .  The  ball  by  actually  win  went  so  so  often  people  think  that  they  have  to  be  looking  at  the  potter  putter  Potter  header  head  something  .  Just  be  aware  of  your  target  and  let  it  go  .  So  these  three  tips  tents  are  gonna  to  help  you  with  the  line  ,  and  the  speed  ,  which  is  what  all  golfers  about  in  and  putting  .  And  when  you  play  played  this  fast  ,  slick  greens  reads  like  a  duster  ,  you're  you  gonna  can  have  a  much  better  opportunity  to  make  more  cuts  and

I  see  now  .  Not  everybody  ,  but  most  people  that  don't  hit  the  ball  straight  part  start  a  bad  position  .  In  fact  ,  that  the  of  to  what  I  mean  by  that  is  they  get  in  front  of  the  ball  .  What  that  does  is  a  lot  of  things  .  It's  a  major  power  league  has  as  you  cannot  hit  the  ball  on  the  upswing  from  over  here  .  So  how  do  we  fix  that  .  I  like  to  give  you  things  to  think  about  .  One  of  them  is  we've  all  skipped  skip  the  rock  rocks  Rock  across  a  the  lake  or  river  right  write  what  you  know  when  and  you  do  that  is  as  you  relax  ,  you're  always  right  here  ,  you  get  skip  the  rock  rocket  across  a  the  lake  like  this  .  They  didn't  did  go  down  in  the  water  .  He  stayed  behind  it  and  in  use  you  spread  across  their  there  lesson  that's  key  right  there  is  staying  behind  it  and  you'll  see  that  the  you  two  left  leg  is  straight  .  You're  you  your  right  knee  is  as  meant  many  you're  pushing  it  a  little  bit  and  rotating  rotate  rotator  hips  through  ,  and  then  it's  a  perfect  way  of  looking  about  the  golf  swing  right  so  you  he  had  to  skip  the  rock  Rock  ,  you  he  may  be  ,  you  hit  a  home  run  hit  a  home  run  of  at  the  same  action  is  staying  behind  it  you  he  crack  cracked  the  a  whip  .  You're  you  right  there  .  A  lot  of  these  things  will  help  your  golf  game  if  you  he  stayed  stay  behind  the  ball  .

John  Chapter  chapter  15  versed  first  verse  well  twelve  this  is  my  commitment  that  you  love  one  another  as  I  love  you  .  No  nope  Noel  greater  love  hath  no  man  than  less  that's  that  than  a  man  lay  down  his  life  for  his  friends  .  Where  are  out  the  veterans  have  of  died  in  combat  .  Well  ,  they've  laid  down  their  lives  as  is  No  no  Greater  greater  Love  love  is  Is  men  Man  man  displayed  no  greater  love  for  their  country  .  no  greater  better  love  for  their  the  nation  .  Yet  today  ,  how  many  people  honor  and  pray  and  thank  God  for  those  little  gone  on  and  done  it's  a  sad  thing  when  you  go  up  to  the  VA  he  you  go  up  got  to  the  seventh  and  eighth  floor  you're  you  fine  find  .  that's  a  the  floor  they  move  remove  everybody  to  die  .  Everybody  up  there's  there  diet  dying  nobody  we  up  there  is  going  gonna  to  become  a  now  well  when  will  we  up  there  is  going  gonna  to  have  any  more  future  they  they're  there  are  pretty  much  done  and  they  get  there  .  And  you  wonder  ,  I  wonder  how  many  people  remember  these  men  man  .  How  many  people  remember  their  service  summary  people  remember  their  stories  .  what  stories  have  they  gone  how  did  they  help  provide  for  our  freedom  .  It  should  matter  to  you  .  you  young  kids  ,  they  should  matter  to  you  .  is  men  man  have  stories  these  people  have  stories  these  people  have  contributed  to  things  it  may  seem  like  a  small  party  part  you  friend  Frank  .  But  they  there  are  aren't  they  all  add  up  to  the  freedoms  that  we  hold  there's  a  reason  why  we  don't  speak  German  .  Tonight  that  their  reason  is  because  we've  had  men  in  this  country  rose  roads  up  and  although  the  leadership  was  wasn't  in  the  blast  best  .  And  although  things  weren't  perfect  not  still  give  our  nation  a  victory  we  have  people  today  that  suddenly  silently  knock  not  knocking  tear  down  the  soldiers  and  the  things  that  they  do  there  goes  on  in  different  ways  .  What  boy  don't  ever  find  yourself  in  a  crowd  .  Thank  God  for  the  soldiers  no  greater  love  has  less  than  a  manly  down  his  life  for  his  country  .  That's  the  same  as  as  friends  right  this  Memorial  Day  when  we  you  knew  get  up  tomorrow  morning  .  spend  the  time  in  prayer  and  thank  God  for  thank  God  for  those  men  that  of  are  gone  on  before  us  .  Thank  God  for  the  the  people  that  had  Baylor  you  ever  walk  through  the  cemeteries  and  see  the  the  men  that  died  in  the  war  for  independence  or  in  the  civil  Civil  war  War  .  And  ask  yourself  .  I  wonder  what  their  story  as  see  their  stories  forgotten  forgot  I  can  remember  being  up  in  New  Hampshire  and  in  stopping  in  an  of  old  cemetery  they  there  was  almost  grown  in  walking  through  the  cemetery  and  look  at  the  stones  read  reading  in  the  the  dates  on  the  finding  several  people  that  died  in  the  war  for  independence  Independence  .  American  civil  Civil  war  War  ,  when  we're  fighting  in  many  that  died  in  the  Civil  civil  War  war  I  wonder  wondered  wanted  to  wonder  what  their  story  as  I  wonder  what  they  contributed  to  I  a  wonder  where  they  flock  fought  ,  one  with  their  families  were  they're  the  for  effort  .  Now  they're  there  virtually  unknown  except  to  the  Lord  God  remembers  them  maybe  their  family  members  of  years  maybe  their  relatives  of  years  you  have  family  relatives  we  would  probably  do  that  we  don't  even  know  about  you've  we've  been  here  for  very  long  .  What  what  they  gave  us  matters  and  God  got  looks  into  the  hearts  of  people  he  sees  gratitude  or  ,  he  sees  a  lack  thereof  .  all  well  we  should  have  a  grateful  heart  I  mean  ,  we're  where  great  if  you're  you  either  by  way  if  you're  ungrateful  or  ,  if  you're  not  grateful  the  proper  way  to  the  veterans  .  You  could  never  make  a  case  that  you're  you  grateful  for  Jesus  could  you  see  it's  a  lifestyle  it's  an  attitude  the  person  it's  its  grateful  for  what  Jesus  Christ  Christ's  has  given  them  will  well  very  easily  be  grateful  for  the  veteran  for  what  the  vet  has  given  Paisley  easily  Paisley's  see  say  it's  not  a  big  slide  is  not  a  big  jump  there  and  for  the  person  they  that  could  care  less  about  the  veterans  you're  you  just  a  big  phony  about  caring  about  price  because  ,  you  see  ,  it's  a  lifestyle  .  It's  a  way  of  thinking  .  A  person  doesn't  think  round  wrong  about  five  things  and  think  ,  right  .  About  one  .  That's  not  the  way  thinking  works  when  you  get  your  thoughts  part  aligned  with  God  but  God's  thoughts  ,  then  your  you're  thinking  is  right  God  himself  said  greater  love  has  no  man  than  this  that  a  manly  down  his  lifers  friends  I  can  remember  my  father  telling  told  me  more  than  once  .  He  says  there's  there  no  heroes  that  they  came  back  all  the  heroes  died  on  the  battlefield  .  What  a  sad  thing  our  nations  nation's  had  some  great  people  some  shown  great  heroes  and  why  watch  some  great  heroes  I  urge  young  people  you  should  read  about  some  of  those  men  it's  amazing  what  they've  accomplished  what  they  did  .  the  power  of  God  ,  by  the  way  ,  there's  no  foxhole  Fox  .  There's  no  Fox  all  atheists  you  know  what  when  a  man  is  in  a  the  foxhole  .  There's  no  atheists  it's  atheist  there  .  It's  kind  of  like  when  you  go  up  to  the  seventh  and  eighth  floor  .  When  you  talk  to  men  dinner  that  on  the  eve  of  their  life  .  Men  that  have  never  been  careful  about  religious  things  men  Medvedev  that  have  never  really  cared  much  about  things  of  God  or  the  Bible  well  all  but  ,  men  man  who've  seen  hundreds  of  their  friends  and  comrades  die  of  old  age  and  complications  of  getting  old  all  .  All  of  a  sudden  lesson  when  you  open  up  and  share  the  gospel  Gospel  not  how  that's  stupid  .  They  know  their  time  is  drawn  strong  close  clothes  never  ceases  to  amaze  me  .  the  power  of  preaching  the  gospel  don't  ever  give  up  on  it  whole  .  This  Memorial  Day  ,  I  hope  you  he  spend  spent  some  time  remembering  not  only  remembering  price  Christ  but  we're  remembering  others  as  well  .  Memorial  memorial  Day  is  about  people  Jesus  ,  by  the  way  ,  he's  is  a  people  there's  there  lots  of  other  people  as  well  .  You  should  remember  those  sort  of  far  those  of  gone  on  in  and  battle  .  Those  who  of  died  .  Those  of  have  come  back  comeback  those  that  serve  you  know  ,  and  it's  it  unknown  this  is  my  commitment  that  you  love  one  another  .  As  I  have  loved  you  John  fifteen  twelve  Memorial  memorial  Day  day  comes  in  and  the  world  will  be  gone  .  This  ends  ,  to  some  people  ,  it's  just  another  day  are  our  bits  it's  to  of  a  vacation  and  that  is  what  it's  supposed  to  be  a  day  when  you  spend  spent  a  little  bit  of  time  remembering  those  that  don't  have  any  life  to  live  anymore  more  .  the  lights  went  completely  changed  he  spent  some  time  thinking  of  action  is  he's  spending  time  frame  praying  for  that  their  followed  follow  father  its  to  burn  terribly  bad  because  an  RPG  in  Iraq  our  he  spent  some  time  frame  praying  for  those  that  have  lost  their  limbs  they  join  joined  the  military  to  serve  their  nation  .  and  gladly  gone  into  battle  .

With  no  sorrow  with  no  all  desire  of  pity  .  while  well  we  sure  can  honor  them  .  But  train  form  formed  by  remembering  and  by  not  forgetting  what  they've  done  for  our  nation  .

A  few  steps  specks  to  consider  under  the  hood  is  a  two  point  forty  to  Atkinson  cycle  four  cylinder  engine  .

So  rather  than  pay  five  dollars  a  gallon  for  diesel  fuel  are  I  thought  to  be  pretty  pre  called  cold  the  bill  available  filled  up  for  free  .  So  on  a  regular  basis  he  collects  used  cooking  oil  from  local  restaurants  cleans  it  up  and  put  it  into  a  special  reserve  tank  the  veggie  oil  is  was  then  heated  he'd  using  a  line  from  the  radiator  and  filtered  sorted  to  white  quite  White's  sternly  attorney  for  supporting  the  Indian  intent  bracket  .

But  once  you  get  movement  moving  move  it  and  in  it  goes  pretty  well  ,  .  The  difference  between  run  on  diesel  and  on  veggie  oil  is  not  a  whole  lot  it  if  it  loses  is  maybe  about  10  to  15  percent  of  power  .

I  don't  know  whether  what  you've  the  he'd  been  even  watching  the  news  ,  but  I'm  actually  quite  nervous  .  The  way  it's  looking  either  the  US  or  Israel  is  planning  on  attacking  Iran  .  Now  when  what  well  I  can't  can  quite  figure  out  is  whether  what  we're  watching  is  a  game  of  chicken  .  You  know  the  game  with  two  people  usually  men  are  in  cars  driving  quickly  in  at  and  each  other  .  The  question  questions  is  who  will  get  gets  out  of  the  way  of  hope  home  .  Maybe  that's  what's  going  on  .  But  what  I  can't  figure  out  is  what  why  could  Israel  and  the  United  immunize  has  been  be  thinking  about  even  contemplating  an  attack  on  Iran  Iraq  .  Now  you  know  the  issues  they're  claiming  that  nuclear  that  Iran  is  developing  nuclear  weapons  .  No  evidence  .  In  fact  ,  to  the  contrary  ,  they're  the  developing  peaceful  nuclear  power  .  Now  you  can  argue  with  whether  weather  the  country  conditions  countries  should  use  nuclear  power  ,  but  there's  a  difference  between  nuclear  power  for  lights  and  nuclear  power  for  weapons  yet  the  talking  of  up  bombing  Iran  now  let  they  us  just  think  for  a  second  .  You  know  and  I  know  what  the  cost  of  gas  is  right  now  .  Last  time  I  checked  its  it's  more  than  four  dollars  a  gallon  .  The  Iranians  have  said  if  they  get  attacked  attack  all  bets  are  off  .  You  yeah  know  ,  I  wish  obviously  we  had  a  map  here  and  show  you  the  streets  straight  of  four  moves  .  It's  one  of  the  main  areas  that  of  oil  use  leaves  the  Persian  Arabian  Gulf  to  come  .  The  West  west  as  in  the  United  States  as  in  Europe  .  You  write  rains  of  have  said  they  get  can  attacked  because  the  streets  of  home  movies  hormones  moves  ,  so  I  don't  know  ,  maybe  ,  like  ten  dollars  a  gallon  .  Maybe  you  like  going  back  to  a  bicycle  .  Maybe  may  ,  like  periodic  outages  maybe  you  like  the  idea  of  perpetual  war  I'm  scared  to  death  .  And  if  you  are  too  .  We've  got  to  do  something  we've  got  to  make  it  clear  this  in  administration  is  not  attacking  Iran  .  And  this  administration  is  not  going  to  let  the  Israelis  do  the  their  dirty  work  for  them  .  Was  my  concerns  .  And  that's  the  way  where  I  say  this  person  Bill  Fletcher  black  Black  commentator  Commentator  dot  com

Though the party&#39;s slogan hearkens back to conservatives&#39; ""America First"" isolationism, the GOP nonetheless supports spending $12 billion a month on the war -- money needed at home. </div><div> </div><div>Same story on economics. In 2004, the Republican White House called outsourcing ""a plus."" In 2006, the Republican commander-in-chief okayed the sale of critical infrastructure to foreign dictators. And today the Republican presidential nominee is demanding more NAFTA-style trade pacts that eliminate American jobs. This, says the GOP, is putting our country first.</div><div> </div><div>But who is the ""country""? According to the Census Bureau, it will soon be mostly non-whites. That is, the demographic groups who the alleged ""country first"" party regularly disparages, whether Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.) yearning for a return to segregation, Rep. Tom Tancredo (R-Colo.) scapegoating Latinos, Rep. Howard Coble (R-N.C.) celebrating Japanese internment, President Bush genuflecting to Bob Jones University&#39;s white supremacists, or Ronald Reagan echoing bigoted rallying cries at the scene of Mississippi race murders.</div><div> </div><div>Maybe, you insist in your post-convention fervor, I just don&#39;t get it. Maybe ""country first"" really does mean refereeing foreign civil wars, spending billions overseas while cutting domestic programs, exporting jobs and bashing ethnic groups that will soon comprise the majority of the nation.</div><div> </div><div>But I don&#39;t think so. More likely, Republicans have simply taken the famous parable to heart -- the one about patriotism being the last refuge of scoundrels.</div><div> </div><div>As a political strategy, it&#39;s not stupid. Following the Bush-DeLay-Abramoff era, many Americans rightly think Republican politicians are scoundrels. And so those politicians are trying to make sure ""this election is not about issues,"" as John McCain&#39;s campaign manager said this week, but about a hideous hypernationalism only Joe McCarthy could love. Employing flag pins, war stories and Bible-thumping social conservatism, former P.O.W. McCain and Christian fundamentalist Sarah Palin hope their red-white-and-blue phantasmagoria will hypnotize America into voting Republican.</div><div> </div><div>Such desperation leads to seeming incoherence at times. For instance, when anti-war protestors at the GOP convention demanded lawmakers actually put country first by bringing the troops home, Republican delegates responded like an entranced mob of cultists, mindlessly chanting ""U.S.A.""</div><div> </div><div>Then again, in the Karl Rove age, every televised scene -- no matter how absurd -- is part of sculpting an election victory with a mallet of jingoism and a chisel of intolerance.</div><div> </div><div>On the seventh anniversary of the 9/11 atrocities, the Republican convention reminds us of what Barry Goldwater suggested 44 years ago: Terrorists are not the only ones who believe extremism is &#8220;no vice.&#8221; And, as the old aphorism warns, when the most virulent extremism attacks our country, it won&#39;t be shrouded in Islamic fatwas - it will be wrapped in a flag and carrying a cross. </div><div> </div><div>Sadly, the when is now.

You're  your  Petraeus  has  just  completed  a  review  of  the  situation  in  Iraq  .  He  and  the  joint  Joint  chiefs  Chiefs  of  staff  Staff  recommended  that  we  move  forward  with  additional  force  reductions  and  I  agree  for  another  response  to  all  this  talk  about  the  a  successful  surge  Middle  East  expert  Phyllis  Bennett's  Benes  from  the  Institute  for  Policy  Studies  at  this  to  say  about  George  Bush's  line  on  and  Barack  Obama's  comment  that  the  search  surge  had  worked  beyond  anyone's  wildest  imagination  I  at  was  wish  least  that  Barack  Obama  had  while  wilder  meanwhile  their  imagination  .  The  surge  was  only  one  part  of  the  reasons  that  violence  is  down  ,  and  it's  not  the  most  important  part  .  The  most  important  part  is  because  the  a  ceasefire  has  been  in  place  for  months  ,  created  by  Moqtada  Al  Sadr  .  That  ceasefire  is  eminently  reversible  and  at  any  time  that  Moqtada  Al  Sadr  decides  to  reverse  the  ceasefire  fire  .  Another  reason  was  the  creation  of  the  so  called  Awakening  Councils  the  US  touts  this  the  says  the  Sunni  population  turning  against  Al  Qaeda  .  Well  ,  what  it  really  means  is  the  US  government  outbid  Al  Qaeda  for  the  loyalty  of  these  people  .  The  US  now  pays  each  of  them  300  dollars  a  month  .  There's  a  hundred  thousand  members  of  this  so  called  Awakening  movement  .  They  get  a  total  of  three  hundred  thousand  dollars  a  month  ,  and  they're  now  not  supposed  to  be  put  under  the  authority  of  the  so  called  government  in  Iraq  ,  which  of  course  is  also  controlled  by  the  US  occupation  authority  .  But  the  Awakening  movement  people  themselves  are  not  so  happy  about  that  cause  as  they're  not  sure  they're  gonna  get  paid  if  they  don't  get  paid  .  We  can  be  pretty  sure  they're  then  gonna  go  back  to  war  against  the  United  States  .  The  third  reason  perhaps  the  most  horrific  is  that  the  ethnic  cleansing  that  was  the  real  reason  ,  especially  in  Baghdad  for  this  huge  horrifying  spike  in  violence  in  2006  and  2007  ,  was  not  arbitrary  or  random  .  He  it  had  a  very  clear  purpose  .  The  purpose  was  to  end  what  had  long  been  these  is  very  mixed  cosmopolitan  Cosmopolitan  neighborhoods  where  were  Sunni  and  Shia  and  Kurds  and  Turkmen  Turk  ANZ  mounds  and  everybody  else  all  live  lived  together  sectarian  forces  moved  in  and  said  ,  we  want  you  out  .  This  is  going  to  be  a  an  all  of  Shia  neighborhood  Sony's  out  or  you'll  be  killed  .  This  is  going  gonna  to  be  an  in  all  Sunni  neighborhood  she  out  or  you'll  be  killed  and  the  killing  went  on  and  on  and  on  ,  and  became  a  killing  field  and  then  when  the  ethnic  cleansing  was  largely  ended  the  killings  killing  that  because  they  didn't  don't  need  it  anymore  more  and  instead  .  You  now  have  a  Baghdad  bad  that  is  divided  into  tiny  mini  many  Mini  little  neighborhoods  many  mini  cantons  divided  by  walls  and  checkpoints  living  under  occupation  ,  and  the  US  says  .  Isn't  it  great  that  the  violence  is  down  and  the  fourth  four  reason  threes  was  the  surge  yeah  you  you  put  30000  troops  into  a  small  area  it  in  a  is  suppressed  violence  .  You're  also  been  suppressed  suppress  normal  life  .  So  the  real  question  is  going  gonna  to  be  ,  how  long  does  this  diminish  violence  last  and  what  role  is  as  the  US  playing  plane  in  making  it  worse  .  George  Bush  has  pledged  to  withdraw  8000  soldiers  by  the  end  of  2009  .  For  those  8000  soldiers  and  their  families  that  is  huge  .  That  is  the  best  news  anyone  could  have  .  But  from  the  vantage  point  of  what  is  the  US  occupation  in  of  Iraq  .  It's  a  drop  in  huge  back  .  There  are  about  a  hundred  and  fifty  eight  thousand  troops  in  Iraq  right  now  you  withdraw  eight  of  them  and  in  you're  your  left  with  about  a  hundred  and  fifty  thousand  troops  that  still  means  10000  more  than  there  they  were  at  the  beginning  of  the  this  so  called  surge  ,  the  US  occupation  is  not  ending  and  no  one  .  None  of  the  candidates  are  calling  to  end  the  peace  movement  has  played  a  huge  role  so  far  in  this  election  .

An intellectual, Karadzic was known to recite verses, accompanying himself on a guitar. But his real instrument was the manipulation. He played Serbian insecurity like a lute. Inhaling popular doubt and anxiety -- about power, money, race and the future... and exhaling racism, nationalism, pride, a sense of wronged entitlement... Villagers became killers, neighbor against neighbor as if they were drunk on fear and lust for power. And the world watched. A deadly combo. The world watched again, when Karadzic was arrested Monday and there were those who asked; How is it that an intellectual and a poet could do such things? We like to think that people like this--the educated ones, the sophisticated ones, the poets for heaven sake --should know better. Don&apos;t they have higher moral standards that ordinary people?

His lyrics touch on all levels of the human condition: the sorrow, the joy, the love, the fear, and the longing. The spirit of the middle class American. Coupled with dynamic musicianship, the music makes for a vibrant and engaging experience, both live and on disc. Drawing from the influence of Ryan Adams, Wilco, and Counting Crows, this young artist is creating music in a brand new world. <br /><br />The first thing you&#39;ll notice about Noah is that he&#39;s a young man. When you hear him sing, you&#39;ll wonder how old his heart is. Combining deeply personal lyrics, acoustic folk-rock guitar work, and a passionate voice, Noah creates emotive songs for his listeners. He expresses personal thoughts in hope that ""someone will hear a song and be touched somewhere in their heart that often goes by unnoticed."" <br />- The Sisters Folk Festival <br /><br />""Brand New World"" gives us a steady, surging feel, a swelling of distended guitars and atmospheric violin. Noah&#39;s vocals-soaring melodies, death-defying emotional acrobatics and pipes that could wail the phonebook and make it sound like a suicide note, make a messy, multidimensional celebration of life. <br />- Patrick Adickes, The Emerald Scene <br /><br />Gundersen&#39;s voice is a multifaceted, subtle thing that imbues his quiet folk with a sense of urgency and importance that acoustic strumming alone could never convey. If you&#39;re even a passing fan of Sufjan Stevens, Josh Ritter or Conor Oberst, Gundersen&#39;s your man. <br />- Jeff Echert, The Pacific Northwest Inlander <br /><br />Go see this dude play a show. Gundersen&#39;s voice is powerful and versatile, yet raw; there are shades of Damien Rice and Adam Duritz -- clear influences reflected in his songs. He has a talent for writing melodies, and has a refreshing presence, void of pretension, contrived emotion, or arrogance. I read a review somewhere that categorized Noah&#39;s music as Christian Rock. That&#39;s bunk. Gundersen&#39;s music had an honesty that can&#39;t be found anywhere in that genre. Can&#39;t wait to hear where he is headed next. <br />- Pete, a fan <br /><br />I don&#8217;t know of any other young northwest artist with the ambition to release a live album. Recording a concert is challenging because what you play is exactly what&#8217;s captured, mistakes included. But this album is engaging because it&#8217;s raw and gutsy. <br />- Tommy, Garage Voice </p>";[];

Since  things  the  first  great  space  opera  in  the  years  year  .

The  ending  of  the  episode  was  absolutely  great  .  I  loved  love  the  cliffhanger  of  them  finding  Earth  and  it's  it  its  in  ruins  .  It's  out  how  with  the  a  three  fleet  is  heading  towards  Earth  was  at  it  epic  and  revealing  and  perfect  .  I  loved  it  ever  James  Olmos  almost  really  has  to  be  given  a  lot  of  credit  for  is  his  incredibly  dramatic  scene  that  that's  seen  scene  in  particular  where  were  Thai  tie  reveals  himself  to  be  a  cycle  on  .  It  was  incredibly  interesting  and  well  written  .  There  were  a  lot  of  interesting  character  development  developments  .  This  episode  has  really  .  The  series  is  driven  by  characters  ,  which  is  great  because  it's  this  good  could  to  have  a  science  fiction  show  that's  it's  not  just  about  space  battles  and  he  doesn't  like  it  has  an  amazing  space  battles  and  some  great  sci  fi  CGI  stuff  there  the  they  weren't  were  really  will  any  big  space  moments  in  this  week's  episode  really  what  it  was  about  was  pushing  the  characters  and  in  of  putting  pushing  the  this  series  for  it  ,  which  I  think  we  need  needed  because  these  we  really  need  to  get  to  that  point  ,  where  the  final  10  or  12  episodes  are  army  officers  .  We  have  we've  left  really  become  about  what's  going  to  happen  to  the  fleet  .  What  happens  ,  the  people  ,  the  characters  .  Some  people  have  been  saying  that  Alastair  Alistair  what  has  been  jumping  the  shark  on  this  season  .  I  am  not  sure  if  I  agree  with  that  but  for  you  doubters  out  there  .  If  you  do  think  it's  been  jumping  the  shark  any  he  sort  of  stopped  watching  get  back  into  it  because  this  week  really  was  a  return  to  form  .  I  kind  of  agree  that  some  of  the  episodes  in  the  past  couple  weeks  awards  have  been  a  little  off  .  But  for  the  most  part  this  season  has  been  solid  and  this  episode  really  makes  me  look  forward  to  the  rest  of  the  series  all  all  really  great  episode  this  week  .  I  really  enjoy  hope  you  do  did  too  ,  .  Next  up  will  be  my  review  of  this  week's  week  doctor  who  midnight  written  by  Russell  T  Davies  .

The  only  thing  standing  firm  on  things  like  lines  okay  a  focus  communication  and  in  Shakespeare  Shakespeare's  is  when  women's  it  counted  college  shots  shot  not  start  showing  positive  signs  toward  you  ,  but  essentially  I  think  move  there's  also  on  forward  who  people  who  have  are  I  you  sort  of  ,  well  ,  few  juicy  lorries  90  dollars  bn  their  son  William  I  I'm  okay  .  The  final  question  of  his  is  character  guys  .

We  with  which  just  if  hit  give  any  he  signs  signed  sign  surprise  or  when  any  he  signs  of  something  stopping  traumatic  dramatically  dramatic  .  Do  you  need  to  be  made  aware  that  two  meeting  shakes  .  So  ,  thank  you  .  We  should  be  looking  at  out  signs  into  ratings  chaos  also  .  Your  or  instability  which  is  not  really  evident  here  ,  and  as  has  only  one  anyone  real  sign  military  three  injury  would  fit  in  with  your  question  and  now  with  we  the  Universe  universe  Calder  Carter  sometimes  speaks  of  the  need  to  get  more  knowledge  .  So  ,  ,  you  know  the  person  who  are  was  probably  from  good  standpoint  ,  there's  still  more  perspective  you  gonna  got  get  yourself  before  you  can  could  actually  be  a  if  they  state  overstated  of  don't  like  liked  life  what  boldly  he  called  call  genuine  Genuine  clarity  about  illegal  the  .  Your  life  is  going  to  go  .  But  we've  we  also  want  got  go  a  lot  to  of  sign  signs  the  measure  is  thinking  there  is  something  you're  going  doing  right  and  you're  not  probably  aware  what  one  it  of  is  these  .  Yet  yeah  there's  something  is  they're  doing  right  .  I  think  that  that's  do  without  that  you  could  fool  pull  Caldwell  called  turned  turns  up  all  on  relate  latest  to  deliberately  avoiding  avoid  order  or  to  be  not  paying  attention  to  things  short  haul  of  a  tragic  okay  ,  so  there  are  some  things  you  really  may  need  to  avoid  ,  but  there's  also  a  sense  of  fun  .  Still  ,  having  haven't  of  being  a  parent  thankfully  agreement  him  doing  what's  right  you  mentioned  your  career  in  the  army  .

These  the  we're  just  gonna  go  through  to  the  make  one  by  one  of  our  13  that  lady  Lady  core  called  duty  Judy  and  said  that  tunes  father  far  is  not  no  part  of  their  lives  and  hasn't  been  for  in  many  ,  many  years  .  He  still  believes  he's  peace  essentially  the  one  for  her  .  So  we'll  would  just  you  settled  quickly  quicker  quick  ,  it  will  we'll  do  a  quick  reading  sealed  steal  feel  seal  the  say  saving  Carter  call  to  reshuffle  so  I'm  doing  now  than  and  just  cutting  a  few  times  just  to  increase  the  randomness  of  care  private  prices  starting  a  your  you're  reading  don't  get  yet  close  relationship  really  methodology  .  This  particular  one  I  right  resigned  yourself  the  science  signs  for  him  40  between  Britain  and  to  the  short  term  mid  term  and  long  term  future  .  And  here's  my  judicial  method  matters  right  ,  so  now  this  is  the  way  awaiting  waiting  it  seems  to  be  working  now  .  I  mean  ,  you  he  added  had  to  the  a  sense  of  connectivity  between  you  can  concede  see  only  out  on  non  the  Prince  of  one's  one  wants  once  fair  here  which  often  represents  showcase  Michael  talk  about  something  like  this  that  in  the  border  port  between  you  .  I  do  know  note  that  is  it's  not  actually  a  symbol  of  lot  though  force  enforcer  between  is  you  so  that  there  are  few  issues  for  breaking  basic  need  needs  to  be  resolved  with  point  that  you  start  to  get  some  real  will  progress  .  ,  but  there  is  an  allusion  to  more  communication  coming  later  on  down  the  line  ,  because  of  course  they  are  .  And  that  I  will  would  deal  with  communications  communication  some  aspects  of  Europeans  mercurial  as  well  ,  signed  sign  the  roadside  side  Judy  doesn't  does  Dutton  strong  sense  of  love  loving  in  connection  with  him  and  the  a  desire  to  communicate  ,  but  also  a  sense  that  they're  are  being  stress  associated  with  that  it  ,  ,  in  terms  of  of  a  conflict  like  feeling  stealing  peeling  moving  mean  everything  over  that  his  side  of  things  ,  and  that's  rather  what  peculiar  because  but  he  also  had  has  loving  energy  for  you  ,  but  very  little  sense  of  communication  were  between  you  UN  and  him  then  coming  from  inside  his  the  reading  Reading  towards  toward  you  .  So  it  seems  like  at  the  a  center  sense  of  tension  attention  always  as  if  he  can  can't  bring  himself  to  actually  communicate  national  Nash  make  things  work  out  right  ,  so  he's  is  actually  being  bad  about  this  that  statue  reflecting  negatively  and  let's  try  and  get  something  sorted  out  the  their  longer  term  ,  the  that  two  looking  very  erratic  right  and  not  give  you  a  straight  straightforward  forward  yes  no  on  so  I  cannot  tell  you  whether  he's  going  gonna  to  come  back  a  or  lot  not  ,  but  basically  I'm  not  actually  seeing  saying  it  him  was  suddenly  returning  there  is  there's  some  it  ,  Allison  Alison  said  .  The  that  communication  I  wish  which  will  have  some  forms  of  conflict  steadily  being  repaired  reversed  so  essentially  conflict  aspect  aspects  of  the  communication  Communication  will  was  slowly  start  heading  getting  ebbing  having  away  way  but  then  we  got  some  some  more  negative  side  before  we  got  the  a  positive  signs  as  the  that  far  fighting  as  the  comments  coming  Commons  you  like  July  sometime  some  within  .  The  next  six  months  short  strong  on  so  there  will  would  be  no  .  But  that  there  is  a  sense  of  that  there  being  mean  something  that  to  you  he  later  on  down  the  line  .  On  that  the  basis  the  do  you  work  at  it  .  If  you  he  can't  can  communicate  with  them  basically  do  hope  that  the  best  thing  I  can  say  ,  well  ,  not  to  be  able  to  announce  Tuesday  they  like  you  work  out  their  the  that  labor  way  Labor  label  base  they  Day  is  not  seen  seeing  that  now  to  take  the  money  and  we've  we  got  a  guy  called  Paulson  and  he  he's  is  a  musician  and  singer  songwriter  very  intuitive  and  he's  talking  about  ,  ,  having  comes  in  some  amazing  physical  sensations  are  seen  seem  to  be  connected  to  his  level  of  your  insight  and  understanding  .  So  that's  ,  that's  pretty  amazing  .  He's  these  good  obviously  got  some  musical  instinct  there  .  His  the  primary  question  is  ,  will  he  continue  to  grow  as  an  artist  ,  I  .  He  Sony  you  also  wants  want  to  find  some  satisfaction  and  persistent  such  that  stained  sense  of  accomplishment  in  and  what  is  he's  already  done  .  And  we've  we  got  a  good  sense  that  these  is  workers  working  work  there  to  make  other  people's  life  lives  easier  ,  so  sorry  he's  looking  trashy  provides  an  extra  benefit  extra  heating  ,  maybe  may  with  other  people's  lives  .  So  do  did  some  quick  look  at  the  a  up  at  with  the  that  time  ,  see  do  what  we  can  get  here  okay  paid  short  term  mid  term  and  long  term  future  I  that  but  we  got  some  sun  here  are  pretty  amazing  and  it  was  associated  with  wealthy  wealth  dirty  don't  talk  about  a  career  has  not  certain  about  a  smooth  poll  Hall  .  The  images  energy  of  that  the  is  on  sun  the  card  car  can  be  interpreted  as  including  energy  hearing  healing  science  signs  as  well  as  those  associated  with  money  and  wealth  ,  and  there  is  a  festive  festival  musical  feeling  being  associated  with  it  that  ,  so  the  thinking  about  ,  ,  well  whether  ,  you're  heeled  gonna  be  able  to  provide  like  inspiration  inspirational  can  weaken  doesn't  about  better  provide  someone  with  some  kind  of  healing  better  to  the  shore  up  to  the  ,  yes  .  The  final  part  thought  here  .  I've  been  attended  the  a  moral  message  about  your  own  activity  agent  quite  pointed  labeled  disabled  interns  and  it  sometimes  means  a  lack  of  willingness  to  be  willing  to  actually  move  forward  so  you  don't  get  have  out  to  praise  appraiser  method  matters  of  how  you  make  base  to  you  develop  new  business  how  you  develop  new  leads  needs  for  people  to  work  with  them  work  for  us  to  be  able  to  get  ,  get  your  you  life  like  sorted  sort  out  the  way  you  want  to  this  very  quickly  expanding  on  that  ,  and  many  only  the  aspects  absence  aspect  of  ,  you  know  how  good  is  going  to  be  ,  ,  ,  well  all  ,  the  these  signs  science  here  and  the  a  form  of  sordid  thank  you  talk  talked  about  being  feeling  a  of  mutual  agreements  agreement  for  for  fall  that  better  benefit  benefits  .  Look  but  for  someone  else  and  yourself  that  the  of  the  appeal  PPO  .  Working  with  people  him  Libya  you're  working  for  .  But  again  ,  associate  with  and  signs  will  it'll  be  worthwhile  ,  according  to  the  reading  rating  on  and  games  Jason  gays  and  get  emails  on  board  by  the  look  of  things  ,  for  some  reason  mean  he  is  it's  he's  a  strong  enough  team  signs  from  FEMA  imagery  and  also  associated  with  money  .  So  ,  for  some  reason  for  you  knew  women  when  it  who  provide  you  with  basically  great  a  you  a  lot  learn  ,  a  lot  ,  a  lot  of  good  fortune  again  this  carelessness  shot  shop  but  that  it  very  quickly  .  Before  we  go  do  one  last  question  for  but  put  today  and  it  is  that  the  someone  who  ,  which  is  to  remain  anonymous  .  Now  no  ,  I  would  say  to  anyone  out  there  is  watching  this  these  ,  you  have  to  be  included  in  the  tariff  .  So  for  the  next  week  or  any  any  artist  doctors  email  may  only  me  do  be  my  YouTube  channel  not  up  more  than  happy  to  help  .  If  you'd  rather  get  a  private  reading  done  down  Don  not  to  be  broadcast  over  the  Internet  .  Then  they  could  do  should  go  to  our  website  net  dash  Booker  for  UK  are  well  bespoke  heighten  group  dot  com  .  And  I  find  Palin  Russians  they're  working  right  I  now  .  This  particular  person  wants  to  know  if  you're  getting  going  get  girlfriends  Prince  girlfriend's  anytime  soon  ,  so  we  we'll  just  have  to  see  what  kind  of  energy  mean  this  summit  it  is  to  someone  else  is  who's  also  a  card  reader  doesn't  resolves  resolve  nothing  softening  sufficiently  competent  confident  to  refer  read  reach  himself  herself  .  But  and  never  mind  is  somewhat  concert  just  their  there  very  weekly  we  face  a  lamb's  tail  okay  ,  we'll  will  do  think  six  poverty  simply  can't  be  done  up  a  longer  long  along  time  and  ,  well  while  ,  we  do  have  some  bad  news  for  we  short  term  future  .  But  could  you  haven't  really  got  me  a  strong  Lidstrom  ,  loving  signs  .  The  agency  also  all  about  that  got  loneliness  and  isolation  that  is  evident  within  the  homemade  card  .  But  and  yes  ,  it  almost  seems  like  whether  when  well  where  you  realize  it  or  not  ,  you  actually  feel  more  comfortable  in  this  these  particular  state  one  of  points  point  talking  about  stability  and  so  sorry  got  that  stability  essentially  through  the  sense  of  isolation  within  his  short  term  extending  into  the  midterm  term  .  So  sell  anything  up  to  six  months  from  now  ,  you  may  still  be  single  because  you've  got  no  real  loving  living  signs  science  coming  through  problem  one  down  that  the  line  ,  and  it  looks  like  you've  got  a  rather  erratic  like  life  ,  there's  placing  been  too  many  other  factors  coming  in  July  ensure  .  You  view  will  need  your  attention  more  than  just  loving  energy  so  narrow  now  they  were  more  interesting  .  Towards  the  end  of  the  reading  room  when  .  We  got  some  signs  of  ,  fun  and  stability  .  So  for  instead  of  isolation  and  stability  instability  to  do  that  we  had  have  early  on  all  ,  we  now  find  signed  the  fun  pollen  and  recreation  in  and  the  a  wheel  of  fortune  ,  suggesting  they  see  coming  out  of  the  shell  show  .  The  they  then  more  idiotic  for  life  .  Armed  with  a  the  Portuguese  upright  as  well  to  let's  get  it  ,  but  that's  next  to  the  four  desks  gifts  or  of  global  political  local  power  and  that's  that  has  talk  talked  about  a  sense  of  stability  ,  so  I  never  watch  myself  so  why  while  these  he  he's  two  to  were  work  together  ,  and  I  would  say  the  instead  of  developing  European  stability  instability  to  isolation  young  developing  instability  could  be  giving  being  out  there  in  the  world  ,  so  it's  basically  a  message  to  get  yourself  out  there  .  Experiment  with  different  social  scenes  strains  .  I  mean  ,  of  course  .  We've  got  in  the  middle  .  That's  the  still  sort  of  a  lot  of  hope  lessen  in  the  signs  science  called  a  successful  sticks  and  swords  and  also  a  sense  of  fun  some  with  them  wisdom  from  your  point  of  view  ,  think  things  is  still  very  proud  of  her  your  .  I  did  you  get  that  develops  more  flexibility  because  on  found  that  ,  albeit  they'll  in  attendance  the  tendencies  see  that  the  women  you're  you  are  gonna  come  across  to  get  a  life  .  But  you  know  you  your  longer  term  future  signs  signed  there  they're  their  actually  looking  very  ,  very  good  indeed  .  And  ,  ,  so  I  would  say  yeah  ,  you  may  have  over  six  months  away  ,  but  basically  don't  worry  a  your  little  ahead  .  It  does  doesn't  look  like  it's  this  gonna  going  can  happen  for  forty  you  it  it's  working  up  lest  that's  one  and  all  .  Nick  make  that  money  playing

All  right  ,  it  meant  they  themselves  with  some  forms  of  therapy  benefit  benefits  that's  right  now  .  We  got  the  first  reading  of  today  .  We've  got  a  guy  called  wrong  role  who's  whose  had  has  readings  in  the  past  two  months  most  to  just  get  got  a  bit  of  clarity  on  be  the  out  on  of  the  various  artists  aren't  arms  who  they  were  provided  by  the  reader  ,  so  that  as  is  my  trade  on  I'm  this  just  customer  data  times  I'm  find  stupid  increased  the  to  randomness  ,  right  I  .  But  so  the  only  shop  their  very  February  group  parody  .  Well  but  ,  let's  see  what  we  was  we've  known  know  to  that  it  at  see  the  what  happened  here  there  .  It  first  thing  is  Ross's  harder  had  reading  and  in  about  the  recent  falls  polls  ,  and  Andy  it  a  really  real  Reid  one  spoke  of  a  new  relationship  developing  what  has  have  is  not  come  across  this  as  person  first  yet  India  .  I  want  to  know  they  see  what's  going  on  there  the  their  ,  alleged  to  have  a  quick  look  what  with  were  they're  sure  progression  coming  through  .  ,  I  know  it's  interesting  because  you  it  can't  can  be  getting  unveiling  on  the  strength  of  the  reading  is  that  you  you've  be  been  looking  out  your  you  heartless  heart  person  I  mean  the  message  here  is  that  we  you  now  know  out  of  that  loving  energy  that  he's  you  you've  out  got  of  a  this  list  of  to  the  the  disabled  stable  character  a  strong  female  character  coming  into  in  life  as  well  .  Or  who  but  why  would  there  be  a  message  in  the  a  reading  Reading  ,  there  that  could  be  summarized  by  the  school  pool  called  and  I  that  can  only  be  a  question  of  not  not  paying  paid  .  Do  you  want  to  a  change  to  two  things  which  are  important  .  It  is  my  feeling  that  there  is  a  character  who  has  been  around  you  laughed  last  about  an  interest  in  you  new  who  ,  who  ,  for  whatever  reason  reasons  Europe  you're  not  felt  that  those  post  in  the  summer  light  right  years  by  the  fact  that  there  was  potential  for  each  peace  progress  progressed  so  this  does  seem  to  be  a  character  you  have  come  across  ,  or  all  had  some  kind  of  interaction  rate  with  but  I  are  you  misread  miss  the  signs  that  us  of  she  was  communicated  communicating  science  decides  size  to  ,  you  know  ,  it's  just  there  their  ,  that's  your  potential  relationship  in  the  operate  over  the  next  six  to  12  month  period  is  in  a  dramatic  change  in  perspective  ,  which  is  coming  through  here  in  in  its  this  own  sold  caught  our  eye  .  I  was  leading  to  a  sense  of  being  a  lot  love  being  nurtured  being  looked  after  .  That  is  his  present  presence  here  in  and  the  emperor  end  right  sites  ISA  so  we  we've  got  regatta  a  story  stories  coming  through  the  you  might  already  know  the  deep  person  mean  we  obviously  Nazi  cloned  cards  cause  can  often  referred  refer  to  someone  you  already  aware  of  a  lot  what  of  met  men  the  main  message  of  the  reading  it  at  is  .  A  change  in  attitude  which  is  going  to  bring  about  the  end  result  of  you  .  Developing  a  relationship  and  that  essentially  them  .  The  main  message  there  this  right  now  you  are  thinking  about  Becky  big  higher  Hire  economic  times  desirable  desire  career  progression  .  You  ask  asked  me  whether  you  want  what  are  ,  you  should  stay  where  you  are  now  that  the  follows  powers  work  workers  is  concerned  and  get  some  part  time  work  on  .  On  the  way  .  All  or  right  whether  ,  there  is  it's  actually  more  importantly  important  you  face  the  find  something  new  .  This  is  not  the  main  rescued  .  I'll  are  be  we  getting  through  there  .  In  this  particular  case  is  that  of  familiarity  .  So  stay  where  you  are  now  .  But  also  ,  I  would  say  that  being  feeling  feeding  of  a  diversification  .  Yes  ,  there  is  a  sense  of  going  you  it  ,  you  are  want  in  the  future  .  So  I  would  say  that  you  know  you're  going  through  at  the  moment  is  probably  preparation  for  all  those  self  employed  not  need  only  needs  to  be  medicated  four  for  years  down  the  line  okay  but  for  the  moment  ,  stick  with  what  you've  you  got  days  day's  sell  so  something  extra  next  .  We  are  seeing  signs  of  financial  day  on  the  horizon  for  you  .  That  is  the  be  associated  associate  with  a  major  career  decision  .  A  the  couple  years  years'  time  they  thought  sought  felt  that  the  a  part  time  work  parties  are  over  ,  stay  where  you  are  now  ,  it  seems  ,  be  the  beneficial  mean  in  you  don't  have  to  go  self  employed  .  There  is  a  change  happening  think  happened  four  years  down  the  line  ,  which  is  going  that  be  every  bit  .  If  you  do  choose  to  carry  on  working  for  other  people  ,  then  essentially  having  ,  you  know  ,  a  longer  a  longer  period  of  employment  with  somebody  that  you  can  can't  be  used  in  isn't  mortgage  small  Morgan  .  We've  got  a  guy  who's  called  Jap  Jack  the  plate  place  is  working  out  at  at  the  moment  it's  it  its  truly  is  about  to  expire  .  He  his  loved  his  work  there  seriously  here  .  He  loved  love  his  this  work  ,  but  it  hasn't  really  turned  turn  into  a  career  .  So  this  inquiry  .  Here's  here  the  whether  weather  he  should  stay  in  the  same  field  will  be  more  will  what  start  Eagle  will  know  basically  Base  war  I  interesting  messages  message  coming  through  here  at  it  five  far  part  financial  stability  is  concerned  concern  yourself  and  I'm  still  seeing  that  we  don't  have  very  strong  academic  academics  signs  signed  found  coming  during  this  particular  reading  readings  swipe  cards  recommend  I  can't  recommend  you  EU  replaced  replace  work  worked  with  studies  buttons  you  he  got  gotta  Karen  parent  focusing  on  the  financial  aspects  aspect  and  keep  on  going  into  the  future  yeah  ,  it  doesn't  does  .  But  like  you've  got  great  instability  where  you  are  now  ,  and  that  is  it's  being  been  quite  bad  maxi  Maxi  against  you  in  accordance  with  the  way  these  the  he  fines  finds  signs  are  interacting  with  each  other  ,  where  way  your  you  life  live  been  together  thank  fake  you  .  Moving  on  into  the  future  .  So  this  is  showing  me  that  the  ,  quite  simply  ,  it  would  be  wise  to  stay  within  the  same  feel  do  studying  part  time  do  not  replace  work  was  with  which  started  to  do  work  plus  buses  voters  voted  vote  part  time  .  That  ,  essentially  ,  the  main  thrust  part  of  this  particular  reading  region  .  But  if  you  want  ,  you  know  ,  the  whole  of  the  rest  of  each  pan  hand  out  and  get  through  to  the  pot  of  gold  at  the  end  of  the  rainbow  ,  so  to  speak  your  euro  year  primary  focus  is  is  to  make  sure  you  you've  start  thought  doing  your  sense  research  the  to  word  you  know  where  to  go  next  .

It's  as  also  got  a  fair  few  people  subscribe  .  Now  no  we've  got  a  couple  of  meetings  do  today  .  This  others  gonna  didn't  go  through  them  one  by  one  ,  we  will  all  try  and  trying  quit  equipped  with  a  few  questions  to  answer  ,  and  the  first  one  this  form  former  a  delightful  like  lady  called  Sarah  hello  Howard  to  as  see  he  what's  was  coming  through  in  the  reading  for  today  .  I  now  she  just  lost  wants  the  a  her  job  and  wants  want  to  know  whether  something  you'll  you  be  coming  becoming  through  three  ,  so  we  just  avoiding  shopping  today  and  as  this  they  to  go  through  very  very  ,  very  quickly  ,  and  we're  going  gonna  to  cover  what's  going  gonna  to  happen  with  saying  she's  she  ,  you  know  ,  just  lost  a  job  jobless  is  was  looking  to  get  itself  back  into  the  world  of  work  .  So  here  we  go  .  Is  if  this  he  reading  with  the  Book  book  of  both  today  and  now  though  it  is  just  covering  some  of  the  basic  changes  .  It's  is  going  gonna  to  happen  .  apparently  now  .  This  is  basically  sleep  on  the  a  Celtic  cross  ,  one  of  the  many  once  one's  values  that  there's  lot  lots  of  other  others  spreads  praised  by  also  used  use  mortars  trying  get  different  varieties  of  clarity  for  the  their  clients  ,  all  right  .  the  signs  here  relate  directly  to  be  in  a  personality  now  out  not  of  personalities  are  essentially  the  concerns  here  as  we  can  see  by  the  calling  Queen  card  .  They're  there  about  trying  to  buy  find  material  stability  to  coin  calling  card  caught  is  reversed  ,  which  shows  feeling  of  instability  and  ,  of  course  ,  consciously  you're  actually  expressing  sorrow  that  means  your  friends  ,  your  family  ,  your  relatives  anyone  you  have  worked  with  him  ,  and  anyone  who  you  may  possibly  be  interviewed  interview  by  would  will  also  know  notice  this  ,  you're  coming  out  with  a  feeling  of  sorrow  and  sadness  at  that  some  you  you're  can  gonna  have  to  deal  with  before  you  can  actually  get  yourself  back  in  the  world  of  work  okay  McCain  ,  this  is  indicating  indicated  you've  got  something  to  have  a  look  at  prior  to  actually  going  go  interviews  they  think  both  of  these  positive  affirmation  is  okay  consciously  okay  ,  we  got  the  to  the  line  nine  of  sorts  souls  ,  which  is  this  take  the  target  has  is  was  labeled  labeled  cruelty  and  in  label  labeled  cruelty  for  very  good  reason  .  And  that's  that  because  it  it's  actually  talking  about  a  feeling  that  the  world  has  had  been  crossed  cross  you  yes  you  were  let  go  .  All  the  wrong  reasons  .  The  company  was  running  low  on  money  .  You  know  ,  it  wasn't  a  question  of  you  haven't  done  the  wrong  thing  you  he  study  studied  hard  ,  you  you've  worked  work  hard  ,  and  yet  it  does  seem  like  the  a  it  world  was  lot  being  cruel  to  you  ,  but  even  in  so  ,  that  is  outside  your  control  .  so  I  would  worry  about  that  too  much  subconsciously  he  here  we  we've  got  some  some  optimistic  signs  sense  of  completion  sense  of  wholeness  and  at  is  his  labeled  on  the  car  because  you  know  a  to  secular  stake  symbol  assembled  ,  but  it's  also  an  eight  air  car  all  right  errant  air  fire  it  deals  with  the  a  subject  of  actually  being  positive  and  thinking  positive  so  essentially  you've  got  the  option  to  be  able  to  move  leave  on  yourself  forward  in  the  right  direction  because  you've  got  the  confidence  there  that  ,  which  I  feel  will  overcome  the  more  negative  sides  we've  seen  there  that  on  the  cruelty  .  So  this  week  that  his  is  call  cool  all  right  I  now  .  They  think  brief  reflection  upon  on  the  past  boss  .  and  when  the  aid  Asian  cuts  cups  here  ,  although  the  caps  in  often  deals  with  and  love  loving  .  In  this  case  it  isn't  dealing  with  a  certain  state  of  mind  state  of  being  ,  I  now  ,  this  particular  sign  signs  pointing  out  a  that  the  sense  all  fearing  the  worst  .  I  mean  ,  I  feel  bad  ,  you  knew  it  was  coming  I  feel  that  you  knew  what  was  coming  .  About  three  to  four  months  down  the  line  .  I  certainly  seventy  a  private  message  if  you  think  I'm  wrong  .  All  right  ,  but  I  think  that's  been  percolating  or  all  invite  inside  you  your  might  mind  ,  you  shouldn't  be  surprised  .  It's  come  comes  to  this  man  now  but  on  the  other  hand  ,  we've  already  seen  too  optimistic  signs  in  the  subconscious  mind  dealing  with  ,  the  future  each  beach  and  how  that's  going  gonna  to  go  so  you  know  you've  got  the  energy  and  vitality  .  An  and  optimism  fell  to  make  something  happen  and  the  anticipation  of  the  that  feature  signs  that  a  lot  of  talk  about  financial  gain  .  So  again  ,  you  don't  have  too  much  to  worry  about  all  right  now  ,  we  want  to  start  cards  cars  that  court  that's  that  you  anticipation  of  the  a  future  .  This  is  what  the  they're  reading  suggested  suggests  that  actually  going  to  happen  now  then  .  bearing  in  your  mind  .  You're  you  looking  for  work  .  The  kind  of  things  were  we're  looking  look  out  for  all  are  signs  relating  to  gaining  branches  branch  stability  and  especially  financial  change  obviously  been  noticing  already  I've  up  been  in  focusing  the  camera  more  that's  less  that  on  of  this  card  target  it  here  .  I  got  the  unions  union  sign  on  it  is  he's  talking  about  change  in  a  very  literal  little  sense  .  And  this  particular  feeling  feeding  this  that  particular  energy  is  coming  in  three  to  six  months  from  now  .  Unfortunately  ,  you're  we're  not  gonna  get  you  need  of  a  up  straight  away  .  I  feel  think  the  Fire  fire  far  Science  here  dealing  with  a  feeling  of  resentment  at  being  a  business  businessman  beating  of  residual  anger  left  over  from  having  gone  to  the  start  block  the  process  of  losing  a  your  job  ,  all  right  ,  so  you  may  have  to  just  spend  brand  a  of  beer  bit  five  time  users  used  time  constructively  to  deal  with  the  fact  that  you  know  you've  got  a  some  bad  about  emotions  emotion  they  if  appeared  appear  to  go  straight  to  a  job  interview  okay  now  serious  about  this  that  doubt  you'd  use  you  goes  go  straight  into  a  job  interview  ,  bearing  in  mind  the  wait  way  away  not  being  at  the  moment  ,  you  won't  wouldn't  get  the  job  .  okay  ,  so  why  where  what  you've  got  to  do  is  spend  their  time  strengthening  itself  yourself  eating  healthy  food  some  unites  start  thinking  positively  ,  as  well  as  going  through  the  process  .  of  I've  actually  getting  itself  yourself  into  a  new  job  right  now  ,  all  right  .

In  that  regard  we've  he  needs  means  leads  to  go  through  so  that  clothing  further  we  it  did  wouldn't  go  goes  straight  on  and  get  the  stock  okay  ,  you  he  walk  will  straight  outside  .  I  think  you  just  don't  one  mind  I  think  we've  got  another  reading  today  for  a  guy  called  Bryce  Brice  price  ,  who  doesn't  does  want  lot  to  will  of  work  with  his  a  the  band  bang  ,  and  he  wants  to  know  no  if  they  see  how  well  it's  going  gonna  to  go  .  He's  also  looking  for  a  couple  of  other  instrumentalists  to  play  along  ,  want  what  to  see  do  whether  that's  international  work  out  okay  as  well  .  They  just  have  a  quick  look  and  see  .  Basically  ,  what's  was  coming  through  .  I  a  try  and  be  as  quick  as  I  can  .  Here  we  go  ,  here  we  do  have  signed  a  victory  .  But  watch  out  right  by  kind  minded  depicting  picture  victory  we've  got  essentially  in  a  chariot  car  because  that  talks  about  having  a  bit  of  a  struggle  .  By  finding  the  way  of  getting  over  it  its  said  that  still  looking  really  rather  positive  really  review  rather  beneficial  for  you  as  you  we  move  on  into  the  future  .  Think  thing  change  changes  is  happening  .  We  got  these  designs  here  which  is  NT  that  pointing  out  difficulties  now  behind  main  Main  car  sometimes  means  treachery  .  I  don't  think  that  means  treachery  in  a  literal  sense  in  this  particular  case  ,  but  it  does  point  out  rather  complex  social  interactions  with  yourself  itself  himself  and  other  band  members  .  The  that  fact  that  we've  got  victory  signs  .  We  got  change  chains  signs  suggest  you  yes  ,  you  are  gonna  going  get  the  other  players  do  you  need  ,  and  they  are  gonna  to  be  a  roughly  rapid  Iraqi  the  right  rights  but  expected  expect  to  be  some  changes  on  the  way  the  tennis  tendency  always  all  it's  see  it's  sometimes  called  brewing  in  and  indicated  case  that  not  mean  me  to  say  you're  your  gonna  move  into  a  state  of  ruin  .  As  far  as  the  relationship  with  the  band  members  are  concerned  ,  it  is  thought  about  a  tenth  of  difficulty  and  struggled  struggle  so  I  high  I  would  see  that  being  the  interpersonal  in  struggle  ,  struggle  to  get  gain  yourself  known  and  all  the  rest  of  that  ,  I  already  recommend  major  your  website  now  is  it's  called  song  called  music  dot  com  ,  which  you  can  you  sell  value  your  music  means  .  Once  you've  you  actually  got  gotten  some  calling  for  now  .  In  the  meantime  ,  to  and  work  out  .  In  the  longer  run  well  right  now  .  The  army  Hermes  spoke  folk  talking  about  illumination  and  with  wisdom  them  ,  we  don't  quite  know  from  in  this  particular  point  where  the  explosive  and  can  take  you  your  in  week's  ethnic  Netflix  pandering  founder  reading  even  further  .  And  here  we  got  inside  again  waiting  relating  to  happen  is  enjoying  in  what  work  your  doing  and  because  he  you  got  that  with  we've  sides  relating  to  illumination  doesn't  be  it  taking  taken  you  in  the  right  direction  .  I  don't  feel  you  can  can't  stay  in  a  bad  band  situation  forever  .  I  would  say  ,  you  given  can  stay  in  a  bad  situation  for  a  third  time  .  But  it  looks  like  .  After  a  few  years  emails  there  their  for  solo  career  .  That's  the  kind  of  being  fund  found  that  dead  will  it'll  take  years  to  get  there  .  I  wouldn't  would  worry  about  that  too  much  Jeremy  sneak  in  .  It's  a  very  positive  reading  indeed  part  not  I've  of  got  no  concern  for  to  you  and  you  meet  her  in  the  future  ,  okay  ,  we  maybe  the  got  not  other  are  a  guy  guys  who  have  had  at  is  concerned  ,  while  well  his  he's  inquiry  inquiring  .

Right  now  it  we  have  has  signed  it  spreads  spread  to  be  go  able  to  do  this  ,  let's  better  that  have  a  quick  adequately  look  unprofessional  professionalize  professionalized  professional  side  of  things  .

Well  ,  the  reading  it  is  and  that  is  saying  you're  not  with  someone  some  really  is  pointing  putting  out  a  very  strong  connection  with  someone  so  is  not  with  what  someone  like  right  might  now  .

Mayor  Mayor  .  Six  months  ago  .  I  had  never  met  police  plow  Palau  ,  much  less  his  is  children  .  Megan  Kevin  cabin  .  I  was  aware  that  police  pull  out  to  drew  hundreds  of  thousands  people  to  the  waterfront  ,  but  that  frankly  it  was  wasn't  really  my  thing  I  hadn't  haven't  actually  been  to  one  of  his  rallies  about  four  months  ago  .  The  mayor  and  I  bronze  rescues  me  I  guess  was  last  summer  .  Time  Time  flies  Flies  .  The  mayor  and  I  there  their  they're  left  elected  I  actually  run  the  stage  in  front  of  a  hundred  thousand  people  ,  which  was  quite  an  experience  .  And  ,  ,  something  has  happened  here  that  I  think  needs  to  be  acknowledged  as  long  as  I've  lived  in  Portland  .  There  has  been  ,  in  my  view  a  divide  between  the  faith  community  ,  particularly  where  well  call  called  the  more  fundamentalist  .  But  ,  ,  evangelical  wing  of  the  faith  community  and  in  the  city  of  Portland  ,  and  it  has  been  my  impression  that  what  has  frequently  been  accentuated  in  that  relationship  is  the  differences  and  there  have  been  some  people  both  in  government  and  in  the  faith  community  who  in  my  opinion  ,  have  been  very  effective  at  emphasizing  those  differences  and  as  we  know  ,  it's  it  easy  easier  is  to  pick  a  fight  .  It's  much  harder  to  actually  find  the  common  ground  I  and  know  that  in  my  marriage  so  .  So  I  have  watched  this  relationship  evolve  it  evolved  and  I  will  tell  you  ,  I've  I  I'd  watched  watch  live  you've  always  all  some  skepticism  .  And  I  think  the  skepticism  was  shared  by  many  folks  in  the  faith  community  as  is  I've  heard  expressed  at  it  various  gatherings  .  But  what  has  happened  ,  I  think  ,  is  that  this  idea  of  a  season  of  service  has  as  has  such  a  powerful  resonance  with  but  all  of  us  ,  regardless  of  our  faith  and  regardless  of  our  past  that  he  has  it  has  provided  the  sort  of  baseline  for  new  relationship  of  understanding  and  in  her  and  mutual  respect  and  the  season  of  services  .  I  am  fond  of  saying  .  Of  it  the  with  three  most  was  us  beautiful  worsening  this  language  .  And  if  the  season  of  at  service  was  a  rose  Rose  arose  .  We  hope  it's  a  perennial  and  not  an  annual  and  I'm  so  pleased  the  plow  Plough  organization  and  and  Pastor  Rick  McKinley  and  all  of  the  folks  involved  and  have  said  this  is  going  to  be  an  annual  event  .  .  And  what  does  it  mean  .  It  means  that  in  addition  to  our  existing  partners  in  the  non  profit  nonprofit  community  and  in  the  business  community  .  The  faith  community  has  is  now  stepped  up  and  said  ,  we  want  part  of  solution  .  And  as  you  know  ,  during  these  lean  times  .  Government  can't  can  do  it  all  .  In  fact  ,  we  can  do  less  West  than  and  we  hope  hoped  help  and  they  the  need  as  is  us  genus  Jeanne  .  This  document  is  going  through  the  roof  ,  so  to  they  have  had  the  faith  community  step  up  and  say  we  won't  won  be  part  of  solution  is  very  powerful  .  So  as  the  housing  commissioner  for  the  city  ,  and  one  from  above  about  my  heart  think  all  of  you  for  your  great  work  on  this  and  and  I  hope  this  inspires  other  others  to  step  up  and  be  helpful  and  to  help  in  this  .  In  this  time  of  need  .  Im  Im  I  wanna  won  closed  with  a  quote  quoted  of  Dr.  King  and  on  service  that  debt  that  they  we're  were  all  familiar  with  ,  but  I  think  captures  the  essence  of  what  you're  doing  and  that  was  at  one  point  ,  Dr.  King  said  of  service  .  Everybody  can  be  great  because  anybody  can  serve  you  don't  have  to  have  a  college  degree  to  serve  you  don't  have  to  make  your  her  subject  in  firm  from  infirm  agreed  to  serve  you  only  need  a  heart  full  of  grace  and  a  soul  sold  sole  generated  by  love  mouth  .  I  think  that  absolutely  beautifully  captures  this  partnership  and  we  are  grateful  for  the  hundred  thousand  dollars  which  will  make  a  difference  .  The  to  lives  of  families  and  children  and  will  we  afford  for  a  to  the  building  on  this  relationship  going  forward  again  .  Thank  you  for  your  service  to  our  our  great  city  .  Thank  you  very  much  .

After  all  ,  but  by  Edwards  Obama  and  Clinton  dropped  out  of  the  Democratic  nominating  contest  following  New  Hampshire's  primary  ,  he  said  says  ,  sued  the  network  .  The  judge  agreed  ,  arguing  that  it's  good  for  voters  to  hear  from  someone  other  than  the  big  three  ,  and  today  NBC  MDC  says  they'll  appeal  that  ruling  .  Now  the  debate  starts  in  just  a  few  hours  ,  so  keep  an  eye  on  now  and  Alan  throughout  the  afternoon  ,  finally  today  super  delegates  superdelegates  they  can't  can  fly  .  They  don't  have  X  ray  vision  ,  but  they  can  can't  go  to  the  Democratic  National  Convention  this  summer  and  vote  for  whoever  they  darn  well  please  remember  the  Democratic  and  Republican  nominating  contests  are  all  about  winning  delegates  .  Each  state  has  a  certain  number  of  delegates  at  stake  in  proportion  to  that  state's  population  you  win  the  most  votes  you  get  the  most  delegates  .  You  get  the  most  delegates  you  win  the  nomination  .  It  sounds  fairly  well  Democratic  democratic  accepted  except  is  this  one  part  party  the  part  about  that  superdelegates  delegates  and  rare  for  an  hour  just  talking  about  the  Democratic  Party  to  understand  super  delegate  superdelegate  .  You  have  to  go  all  the  way  back  to  the  early  nineteen  seventies  ,  when  the  primary  and  caucus  process  was  first  instituted  before  that  it  he  was  just  the  Democratic  National  Committee  and  select  party  bigwigs  who  are  chosen  chose  their  nominee  a  primary  process  was  created  as  a  more  representative  way  of  choosing  that  their  nominee  ,  but  to  keep  those  party  officials  happy  .  The  ones  who  had  previously  held  all  the  marbles  .  They  were  granted  a  certain  number  of  super  delegate  votes  today  there  are  700  and  92  Democratic  superdelegates  delegates  ,  most  of  whom  are  members  of  the  DNC  or  Democratic  elected  officials  .  There  are  3248  regular  delegates  .  The  ones  who  represent  the  votes  of  the  common  folk  .  Now  that's  that  a  total  of  4040  Democratic  democratic  delegates  .  One  out  of  every  five  of  whom  is  a  super  delegate  now  super  delegates  superdelegates  can  pledge  place  their  vote  to  any  candidate  at  any  time  ,  and  right  now  .  Hillary  Clinton  has  the  most  committed  a  it  super  delegates  by  a  wide  margin  .  That's  why  on  this  chart  ,  even  you  though  know  she  lost  to  Obama  in  Iowa  and  in  won  one  by  just  a  slim  margin  in  New  Hampshire  she  leads  leaves  the  delegate  race  by  a  comfortable  margin  the  Democratic  Party  has  been  criticized  for  maintaining  these  the  super  structure  decidedly  eight  a  non  nine  democratic  Democratic  part  of  the  democratic  process  .  But  ,  for  now  at  least  ,  the  these  superdelegates  super  .  Well  ,  they  may  not  be  able  to  save  the  day  .  But  they  are  here  to  stay  .  That's  it  for  political  lunch  today  Rob  and  I  are  right  back  here  tomorrow  .  Keep  denial  an  eye  on  Michigan  today  and  we'll  bring  you  all  the  results  in  tomorrow's  program  thanks  for  watching

When  it  comes  to  economic  policy  .  John  McCain  has  admitted  that  it  is  not  his  strongest  campaign  issue  ,  and  it  looks  like  his  top  adviser  advisor  for  economic  policy  is  Phil  Gramm  .  The  former  Texas  senator  Senator  now  .  Today  I  want  to  take  a  look  at  the  biggest  economic  brains  behind  each  of  the  campaigns  .  So  let's  start  with  Phil  Bill  Gramm  Graham  ,  former  Texas  senator  who  worked  works  work  closely  with  John  McCain  on  several  issues  as  Fortune  editor  Chantal  Sean  reports  its  it's  former  Texas  Senator  Phil  Gramm  ,  who  brings  the  real  economic  strength  to  the  McCain  campaign  .  The  a  former  economics  professor  at  Texas  A&M  and  an  investment  banker  with  UBS  .  Phil  Gramm  also  brings  in  credibility  among  staunch  conservatives  and  he's  is  partly  responsible  for  the  campaign  .  Turnaround  ,  which  McCain  has  enjoyed  since  last  summer  ,  when  many  thought  he  was  dead  in  the  water  .  Now  let's  also  take  a  look  at  Barack  Obama  his  top  economic  adviser  is  a  notable  moderate  for  a  campaign  which  promises  such  dramatic  change  Austen  Goolsbee  is  isn't  known  as  a  man  who's  not  tainted  by  partisan  politics  and  he  tends  intends  to  hold  a  macro  perspective  rather  than  focusing  on  micro  policy  issues  issue  as  George  Will  points  out  Goolsbee  who'll  enjoys  triathlons  and  an  improv  comedy  ,  making  him  a  en  massacre  masse  us  against  with  a  sense  of  humor  ,  perfect  for  politics  Goolsbee  certainly  has  an  excellent  resume  and  is  he's  almost  the  perfect  adviser  advisor  for  a  campaign  ,  however  .  Right  now  ,  the  Obama  campaign  still  struggles  to  come  up  with  ,  or  regional  thinking  to  really  set  him  apart  .  On  the  other  hand  ,  with  his  delegate  lead  right  now  against  Hillary  Clinton  ,  perhaps  .  Obama  Obama's  is  doing  everything  he  needs  to  .  Meanwhile  ,  for  Hillary  Clinton  ,  she  has  Gene  Sperling  early  to  on  as  an  economic  adviser  to  Bill  Clinton  Gene  Sperling  did  much  to  dispel  the  idea  that  Liberals  liberals  cannot  be  pro  growth  is  his  book  booked  the  Pro  growth  progressive  is  an  it  excellent  actually  look  inside  the  mind  of  a  key  figure  behind  the  economic  growth  of  the  nineties  and  the  elimination  of  national  debt  .  Regardless  of  your  opinions  on  his  economic  policy  approach  .  I  think  anybody  will  find  this  book  in  and  lightning  .  So  that's  a  quick  look  at  the  top  brains  behind  the  economic  policies  of  the  campaigns  .  I'm  back  on  Monday  will  well  is  back  tomorrow  with  your  13  thanks  for  watching  we'll  see  you  there  .

Three  minutes  on  the  clock  in  here  goes  does  nothing  we  start  with  Chris  Dodd  died  ,  who  this  week  endorsed  Barack  Obama  .  So  what  about  the  other  two  ,  John  Edwards  and  Bill  Richardson  still  haven't  endorsed  either  candidate  ,  but  they're  not  exactly  uninformed  voters  ,  but  they  are  unemployed  ,  so  maybe  many  they're  holding  out  for  a  VP  spot  ,  or  at  least  the  a  Cabinet  position  ,  died  on  the  other  hand  ,  doesn't  have  much  to  lose  sense  since  ,  he'll  still  have  his  Senate  seat  .  No  matter  what  happens  in  November  and  the  I  remaining  constitution  Constitution  states  that  US  presidents  must  be  born  in  the  US  .  Well  ,  we're  what  about  John  McCain  ,  who  was  born  in  the  panel  Panama  market  mark  Mark  now's  now  owner  yesterday  a  Democratic  senator  introduced  legislation  to  ensure  that  American  children  born  to  military  parents  parent  serving  abroad  or  indeed  eligible  to  be  president  .  The  rates  narrates  less  that's  left  out  of  the  way  .  But  what  about  McCain's  age  he  would  be  the  oldest  president  to  take  office  .  Barack  Obama  would  will  be  the  fifth  youngest  and  Hillary  Clinton  would  be  somewhere  in  the  middle  .  Our  new  poll  out  today  finds  that  few  Americans  actually  care  clear  that  John  McCain  is  a  little  bit  on  the  older  side  it  as  has  a  major  change  from  12  years  ago  when  Bob  Dole's  age  was  a  major  hurdle  for  his  campaign  are  our  seven  set  recent  polls  are  aren't  all  good  couldn't  for  John  McCain  as  a  new  poll  from  Pew  Research  today  finds  that  were  the  election  held  today  .  John  McCain  will  would  lose  to  two  both  Barack  Obama  and  Hillary  Clinton  ,  Barack  Barak  by  seven  points  and  Hillary  by  five  points  .  Number  were  or  6  Clinton  is  once  again  on  the  offensive  ,  leveling  attacks  on  more  or  less  everyone  in  sight  .  First  she  she's  stepping  up  for  her  criticism  of  Barack  Obama  yesterday  ,  borrowing  a  phrase  from  Obama's  own  book  describing  him  as  a  quote  blank  screen  now  Obama  meant  that  people  project  projecting  projected  their  own  impressions  on  him  .  Hillary  used  it  as  further  evidence  of  what  she  claims  is  a  Kennedy  candidate  all  talk  and  no  substance  and  refined  next  Clinton  won  went  when  one  after  the  Texas  Democratic  Party  for  their  wacky  primary  process  which  is  actually  in  both  the  primary  and  caucus  Hillary  knows  she's  less  organized  in  taxes  than  Barack  and  in  will  the  likely  fare  worse  in  you  at  least  the  be  caucus  Caucasus  quite  portion  of  the  event  .  Now  she's  is  pressing  presently  the  Texas  Democratic  Party  to  clarify  the  rules  filed  file  this  its  next  one  month  under  a  worst  possible  reasons  to  go  to  jail  .  A  California  man  pleaded  guilty  this  week  tour  ranging  53000  dollars  in  illegal  campaign  contributions  for  Hillary  Clinton  ,  and  Barbara  Boxer  misguided  guy  been  in  reimbursing  friends  and  family  for  their  contributions  to  the  campaign  ,  and  you  just  can't  do  that  now  3  .  In  a  fresh  take  on  the  it  campaigns  campaign's  .  We  would  go  to  Time  magazine's  Hillary  Hilary  Hilton  ,  who  this  week  described  the  Democratic  race  as  has  not  necessarily  between  Barack  and  Hillary  ,  but  between  Barack  in  Bill  bill  eight  years  later  ,  we'll  will  memories  of  your  plans  and  on  MTV  and  Arsenio  Hall  .

There  they  are  ever  due  two  to  President  Bush  yesterday  made  a  rare  comment  on  the  Democratic  campaign  criticizing  criticized  the  Democrats  on  everything  from  Iraq  to  foreign  form  policy  to  trade  trading  .  And  while  he  didn't  mention  Obama  by  name  President  Bush  had  specific  criticisms  for  Barack  Obama's  stated  willingness  to  meet  with  foreign  leaders  from  ,  say  ,  Iran  or  North  Korea  finally  number  never  won  one  a  new  round  of  ads  hits  the  airwaves  this  weekend  .  Obama's  that  ad  focuses  on  reducing  the  influence  of  lobbyists  .  While  Hillary  is  borrowing  a  page  from  the  playbook  spouse  say  LBJ  or  Walter  Mondale  ,  now  running  for  the  first  time  in  Texas  Hillary's  had  and  asked  viewers  to  consider  who  whom  they  would  want  in  the  White  House  when  the  phone  rings  at  3  and  AM  their  children  are  fast  asleep  .  Any  crisis  has  erupted  somewhere  in  the  world  again  .  Hillary  Hillary's  Hiller  is  trying  to  play  the  reliability  card  and  ,  it  seems  ,  may  be  maybe  a  fair  point  to  consider  .  But  it  does  push  the  Queen  coin  rhetoric  further  away  from  the  Obama  theme  of  hope  .  Some  jurors  point  out  that  the  use  of  emotion  and  fear  could  just  backfire  fire  .  Oh  ,  and  finally  ,  Mike  Huckabee  has  somehow  scraped  scrape  together  enough  money  to  get  his  own  ad  on  the  air  .  He's  focusing  on  flat  tax  and  an  abortion  ,  and  insists  that  he  could  still  be  the  nominee  .  That's  as  it  for  political  launched  lunch  this  week  .  Thank  you  .

The  polls  are  open  in  Mississippi  .  I'm  well  and  this  is  your  political  lunch  Tuesday  snack  well  welcome  connected  mattered  to  little  lunch  launch  .  Well  ,  today  there  was  supposed  to  be  all  about  the  Mississippi  primary  33  democratic  Democratic  delegates  at  stake  .  Obama  ,  holding  a  strongly  strong  .  But  Clinton  ,  aiming  for  a  repeat  of  the  March  march  for  surprise  .  It  had  all  the  makings  of  another  interesting  day  on  the  road  to  the  White  House  but  then  this  happened  that's  right  LA's  I  Spencer  Spitzer  governor  of  New  York  caught  with  a  prostitute  possible  money  laundering  by  now  you  know  the  story  and  you  want  to  know  our  beat  beach  here  political  launched  launch  his  presidential  campaign  politics  ,  so  we  would  were  happily  leave  this  story  very  much  alone  lot  ,  except  that  it  does  have  a  any  real  impact  on  the  candidates  in  particular  this  candidate  as  ABC  News  reports  just  as  Hillary  Clinton  appears  to  correct  the  course  of  her  campaign  .  The  Spitzer  Spencer  iceberg  comes  out  of  the  darkness  in  the  form  of  a  quote  walking  ,  talking  distraction  to  a  campaign  they  that  would  rather  not  revive  memories  of  marital  infidelity  but  revived  revive  .  They  were  last  night  .  Even  David  Letterman  got  in  on  the  act  .  I  thought  Bill  Clinton  legalized  legalize  this  years  ago  .  Spencer  Spitzer  is  ,  of  course  ,  the  governor  Governor  of  Clinton's  home  state  of  political  ally  and  eight  a  Clinton  Clinton's  superdelegate  delegate  also  as  the  New  York  Times  notes  the  political  damage  control  among  Democrats  in  Albany  .  Over  the  next  few  weeks  ,  is  likely  to  sap  sapped  strength  straight  from  Clinton's  campaign  in  her  home  state  in  while  Wall  the  tabloid  headlines  screamed  with  glee  today  over  the  irony  of  in  an  anti  corruption  crusader  snared  in  a  trap  that  might  as  well  have  been  his  own  at  the  candidates  themselves  were  relatively  reserved  on  the  this  subject  .  Hillary  Clinton  and  John  McCain  used  the  wish  his  family  well  and  wait  and  see  what  happens  lines  and  Barack  Obama  had  no  comment  at  all  ,  saying  that  he  was  a  little  unclear  on  the  details  .  Already  ,  the  Republican  National  Committee  has  called  on  5  of  state  upstate  congressional  candidates  to  disavow  Spitzer  and  in  return  returned  campaign  contributions  from  the  governor  .  But  at  the  end  of  the  day  .  It  is  it  likely  that  the  Republicans  will  be  able  to  make  much  political  hay  out  of  this  come  November  .  Given  the  glass  houses  principle  principal  so  and  in  about  their  nonsense  today  in  Mississippi  Democrats  are  eager  to  go  to  the  polls  for  a  vote  actually  counts  for  something  .  As  we  said  yesterday  .  Usually  ,  their  vote  move  comes  too  late  in  the  process  to  be  much  of  a  nail  biter  .  But  Spitzer  bombshell  aside  tonight  .  All  eyes  will  be  on  the  Mississippi  boat  vote  and  there  are  a  couple  of  interesting  things  to  watch  for  .  First  there  is  the  African  American  vote  in  Texas  earlier  this  month  ,  Clinton  fared  much  better  than  expected  ,  largely  because  the  turnout  among  black  voters  .  There  was  lower  than  had  been  forecast  in  Mississippi  .  Back  in  2004  black  voters  accounted  for  56  percent  of  the  Democratic  turnout  if  that  number  holds  again  this  time  around  ,  it  will  mean  good  things  for  Barack  Obama  .  The  other  question  is  the  role  of  Republicans  and  moderates  Mississippi  holds  an  open  primary  .  That  means  anyone  can  vote  for  any  candidate  ,  regardless  of  party  affiliation  .  Traditionally  ,  Barack  Obama  has  had  the  advantage  among  moderates  and  crossover  Republicans  but  this  time  ,  Hillary  Clinton  ,  according  to  the  polls  .  Has  the  edge  among  Republicans  and  moderates  who  might  be  tempted  to  cross  party  lines  .  So  ,  it  it's  still  looks  likely  like  that  Obama  will  walk  away  with  a  win  the  today  in  Mississippi  .  But  Hillary  Clinton  made  may  managed  manage  to  keep  things  surprisingly  clubs  .  One  final  note  .  Today  ,  we  received  receive  a  comment  from  a  political  life  lunch  viewer  you're  in  Florida  .  David  is  a  registered  Democrat  and  in  Sunshine  State  and  he's  frustrated  about  the  continuing  indecision  over  the  feet  feat  of  Florida's  Democratic  delegates  David  also  notes  that  the  early  primary  in  Florida  was  an  initiative  of  the  Republican  controlled  state  legislature  Legislature  and  now  Democratic  voters  they're  there  being  punished  for  something  they  had  little  control  over  that  now  .  It  is  was  result  out  also  of  them  the  if  myth  that  they  we  said  Hillary  Clinton  was  the  only  Democrat  on  the  ballot  in  Florida  .  That  wasn't  the  case  .  Maybe  there  you're  right  .  We  were  thinking  of  Michigan  .  That's  it  for  from  political  lunch  .  They  today  will  we'll  be  back  tomorrow  with  the  results  of  the  Mississippi  primary  if  you  catch  in  a  state  mistake  where  or  if  you  just  need  to  get  something  off  her  chest  ,  leave  a  comment  at  that  political  launch  lunch  dot  com  thanks  for  watching  exploiting  we'll  see  tomorrow  .

Consider yourself lucky. (Earmarks are seriously boring.)";['politics', 'political_lunch', 'democrats', 'florida', 'clinton', 'obama', 'pennsylvania', 'race']; It's  Tuesday  March  18th  .  I'm  well  and  this  is  your  political  life  lunch  launched  Tuesday  snack  ,  welcome  back  to  political  less  today  ,  we  have  had  two  major  news  stories  from  the  campaign  trail  .  First  ,  some  bad  news  for  our  viewers  in  Florida  late  yesterday  it  was  announced  that  there  will  be  no  revote  votes  in  the  Florida  Democratic  primary  in  an  email  Florida  Democrat  Democrats  democrats  state  party  chairwoman  Karen  Thurman  said  we've  researched  every  potential  alternative  process  from  caucuses  .  The  to  county  conventions  to  mail  in  elections  ,  but  no  plan  could  come  anywhere  close  to  being  viable  in  Florida  .  So  now  what  at  .  What  one  of  that  about  state's  States'  first  vote  held  back  in  January  .  And  in  what  one  of  the  state's  two  hundred  and  ten  Democratic  democratic  delegates  will  Florida  democrats  Democrats  simply  go  unrepresented  at  the  nominating  convention  in  Denver  this  summer  .  Or  will  the  Democratic  National  Committee  relent  and  accept  the  results  from  what  most  people  view  as  a  flawed  first  primary  .  At  this  point  ,  of  course  ,  it's  still  uncertain  .  We  are  ,  in  essence  ,  back  where  we  were  a  month  ago  .  Before  the  push  for  a  revote  1.7  million  Democrats  showed  up  to  vote  in  Florida  primary  .  Back  in  January  ,  and  for  them  the  idea  that  their  delegates  will  be  barred  from  the  national  National  convention  brings  to  mind  the  disenfranchised  disenfranchise  meant  met  many  felt  back  in  2000  .  When  the  general  election  in  and  their  state  was  decided  by  the  courts  .  After  hanging  chads  and  an  endless  recounts  recount  .  Now  the  primary  matter  is  in  the  hands  of  the  Democratic  National  Committee  at  this  point  ,  and  more  specifically  in  the  hands  of  Howard  Dean  who  up  until  this  point  has  showed  little  interest  in  compromise  so  repercussions  for  Floridians  aside  side  ,  what  does  this  mean  for  Hillary  Clinton  and  Barack  Obama  well  this  point  disappoint  .  Hillary  Clinton  ,  of  course  ,  needs  all  the  votes  boats  and  in  all  the  delegates  she  can  get  and  Florida's  bloc  block  of  moderate  Democrats  had  tended  to  favor  Hillary  over  Barack  and  in  well  if  the  a  Florida  Democrats  democrats  are  allowed  to  attend  the  convention  .  And  if  they  represent  the  candidates  in  proportion  to  the  first  primary  does  put  more  delegates  in  Hillary's  column  ,  not  enough  to  close  the  gap  .  But  it  will  help  and  why  he  you  certainly  won't  catch  anyone  from  the  Obama  team  saying  this  out  loud  .  The  best  possible  outcome  in  their  interests  ,  is  no  change  all  Howard  Dean  Dean's  sticks  by  his  guns  in  Hillary  gets  none  of  the  delegates  she  earned  back  in  January  .  No  word  yet  on  when  this  will  finally  be  decided  now  no  second  secondly  big  story  today  was  a  landmark  speech  given  during  this  morning  by  Barack  Obama  on  the  subject  of  race  in  America  was  Mrs.  a  speech  prompted  for  the  most  part  by  concerns  over  remarks  made  by  his  former  minister  .  The  minister  had  made  remarks  .  They  there  were  considered  by  many  to  be  not  just  factually  dubious  but  also  in  Thai  time  American  and  in  racially  inflammatory  in  recent  days  .  Obama  has  denounced  those  remarks  he  did  so  again  this  morning  .  But  he  also  said  he  would  not  disown  someone  who'd  been  so  influential  throughout  his  life  .  More  importantly  ,  though  Obama  used  a  the  speech  which  was  broadcast  in  its  his  45  minute  entirety  by  most  major  cable  news  networks  to  open  a  broader  discussion  of  race  in  America  and  in  that  is  a  bold  move  for  a  candidate  who  in  some  states  has  won  90  percent  of  the  black  vote  by  but  just  30  percent  of  the  white  vote  .  And  it's  as  a  bold  move  ,  especially  with  such  important  contest  on  the  horizon  in  Pennsylvania  ,  a  state  that  is  overwhelmingly  white  .  Well  ,  think  of  it  this  way  .  The  Clinton  campaign  has  long  contended  that  Obama  cannot  can  him  and  all  the  rough  and  tumble  nature  of  politics  .  So  what  does  it  say  about  his  constitution  that  he  chooses  to  take  such  a  bold  approach  on  such  a  controversial  subject  at  such  a  critical  time  .  Now  well  that  is  up  for  the  voters  to  decide  .  With  just  over  a  month  left  before  the  Pennsylvania  primary  .  New  polls  released  today  put  with  Hillary  Clinton  .  More  than  15  points  ahead  of  Obama  in  the  Keystone  State  but  will  that  lead  hold  or  will  today's  speech  changed  change  the  ballgame  game  and  we'll  will  win  in  Pennsylvania  ,  be  enough  to  put  Hillary  back  in  the  hunt  .  Of  course  ,  we  don't  know  .  We'll  just  have  to  wait  and  see  .  That's  it  for  your  political  lunch  Tuesday  snack  thanks  for  watching  .  We're  back  tomorrow  .

By  now  ,  you  know  that  late  on  Sunday  night  .  Another  grim  milestone  was  reached  in  the  Iraq  war  .  Four  thousand  US  troops  have  been  killed  there  since  fighting  began  five  years  ago  ,  and  tens  of  thousands  have  been  wounded  .  For  the  Bush  presidency  .  The  Iraq  war  has  become  the  defining  issue  and  in  for  whoever  takes  the  Oval  oval  Office  office  nasty  will  certainly  be  the  most  pressing  challenge  .  But  on  the  campaign  trail  .  These  days  ,  it's  usually  the  economy  or  healthcare  care  or  immigration  reform  that  gets  top  billing  .  Iraq  a  ranking  somewhere  further  down  the  list  in  the  a  media  coverage  of  the  Iraq  war  ranks  lower  now  that  at  any  point  over  the  last  five  years  .  A  Pew  Research  study  found  that  just  3  percent  of  news  coverage  now  is  about  the  Iraq  war  .  Only  28  percent  of  the  American  public  has  hasn't  even  a  vague  idea  of  the  number  of  US  casualties  so  freer  your  political  last  lunch  Tuesday  snack  .  We  with  have  a  few  tips  on  how  to  learn  more  about  where  Barack  Obama  ,  Hillary  Clinton  and  John  McCain  stand  on  the  Iraq  war  .  We'll  will  start  with  John  McCain  was  is  set  to  deliver  a  major  policy  speech  tomorrow  there  is  expected  to  focus  largely  on  Iraq  ,  you  you'll  you're  recall  and  came  as  Iraq  briefly  during  his  trip  abroad  ,  which  concluded  just  a  couple  of  days  ago  ,  returning  to  the  campaign  trail  yesterday  McCain  said  that  we  are  succeeding  in  Iraq  and  accused  the  Democrats  of  quote  wanting  to  pull  out  in  and  court  quote  ,  refusing  to  understand  the  situation  there  McCain  went  on  to  say  we're  succeeding  in  Iraq  and  don't  care  what  anyone  says  ,  I've  seen  the  facts  on  the  ground  ,  and  in  it's  its  this  as  USA  Today  noted  the  day  before  he  made  that  comment  .  Four  US  troops  were  killed  in  Iraq  ,  as  were  61  Iraqis  earlier  this  year  ,  he  commented  that  if  he'd  be  willing  to  keep  US  troops  in  Iraq  for  100  years  if  necessary  .  And  in  recent  days  .  McCain  and  his  advisers  advisors  have  repeated  repeatedly  that  controversial  willingness  to  establish  a  permanent  US  military  presence  .  So  tomorrow  ,  you  can  look  for  speech  to  further  outline  in  those  plans  .  As  for  the  Democrats  Hillary  Clinton  hits  the  campaign  trail  today  with  Congressman  John  Murtha  in  it  noted  defense  hawk  turn  turned  Iraq  war  critic  .  In  2005  Murtha  murder  call  called  for  immediate  withdrawal  of  all  US  troops  from  Iraq  .  But  while  stumping  for  Hillary  .  This  morning  ,  Murtha  Martha  mostly  avoided  the  subject  of  Iraq  ,  instead  praising  Clinton's  capacity  as  commander  in  chief  ,  once  considered  a  moderate  on  the  Iraq  war  .  Clinton  has  is  now  more  aggressive  in  her  calls  for  immediate  troop  withdrawal  at  a  campaign  stop  yesterday  in  Pennsylvania  ,  Clinton  said  .  Quote  .  There  is  no  military  solution  to  resolve  their  internal  disputes  Hillary  says  she  plans  to  convene  the  a  joint  Joint  chiefs  Chiefs  and  give  them  60  days  to  come  up  with  a  plan  for  a  phased  troop  withdrawal  .  Then  ,  if  Barack  Obama  ,  who  has  made  a  campaign  trail  habit  of  questioning  question  Hillary's  credibility  on  the  subject  ,  because  she  he  did  after  all  vote  for  the  Iraq  war  resolution  .  A  lot  Obama  of  conveniently  was  not  yet  in  the  Senate  senate  at  that  point  ,  but  did  manage  to  get  his  objections  on  the  record  .  And  now  ,  Obama  has  a  fairly  detailed  plan  for  bringing  all  troops  home  from  Iraq  within  16  months  for  more  on  where  Clinton  ,  Obama  and  McCain  stand  on  the  Iraq  war  and  what  they  have  planned  for  their  the  first  days  in  office  .

There  are  just  200  and  eight  days  left  until  the  a  presidential  election  .  It's  noon  known  in  New  York  9  on  in  the  west  West  coast  Coast  route  unwell  I'm  .  And  you're  watching  political  large  welcome  back  to  political  ability  lunch  launch  today  on  Capitol  Hill  ,  and  on  the  campaign  trail  .  Foreign  policy  is  taking  center  stage  from  Colombia  to  the  war  in  Iraq  .  First  on  Columbia  .  I  I'm  and  told  on  Monday  that  Hillary  Clinton  had  shown  her  chief  strategist  .  The  door  after  he  lobbied  for  a  trade  agreement  with  Colombia  that  she  opposes  well  ,  the  big  news  today  is  that  the  Bill  Clinton  also  supports  that  trade  agreement  ,  and  he's  his  collecting  nearly  a  million  dollars  in  fees  to  promote  Colombian  business  opportunities  to  foreign  leaders  Sony  so  campaign  season  marked  by  protectionist  rhetoric  on  trade  is  it's  clearly  Hillary  has  to  oppose  the  agreement  at  least  on  stand  by  with  her  top  strategist  strategists  and  her  husband  on  the  record  as  supporting  the  agreement  .  Some  might  wonder  if  this  is  just  politics  .  And  once  again  it  puts  Hillary  back  on  the  offensive  defensive  .  She  spent  yesterday  again  repeating  her  disagreements  with  her  inner  circle  and  not  talking  about  our  her  opponent  .  But  Columbia  Colombia  began  damned  .  Hillary  has  a  big  night  ahead  of  her  tonight  in  New  York  one  night  only  ,  it's  its  Elton  and  Hillary  that's  right  ,  Sir  Elton  John  will  be  performing  solo  tonight  at  Radio  City  Music  Hall  in  support  of  the  Clinton  campaign  but  in  Washington  today  ,  all  eyes  will  be  once  again  on  Capitol  Hill  ,  where  for  he  you  continued  continue  testimony  of  General  David  Petraeus  and  Ambassador  Ryan  Crocker  on  the  situation  in  Iraq  .  That's  right  .  Today  the  testimony  ,  takes  place  on  the  House  side  .  Yesterday's  yesterday  big  news  from  a  the  day  of  questioning  that  at  the  Senate  was  this  general  General  for  trade  Trade  ,  has  called  for  an  end  to  troop  withdrawals  in  July  .  Petraeus  described  the  gains  made  in  Iraq  as  tenuous  and  reversible  ,  and  he  urged  President  Bush  and  the  Pentagon  to  leave  troop  levels  where  they  are  .  Through  the  summer  .  Yesterday  ,  the  three  presidential  contenders  all  senators  made  a  point  of  leaving  the  campaign  trail  to  attend  the  testimony  and  as  the  New  York  Times  put  it  ,  try  tried  out  for  the  role  of  Commander  commander  in  Chief  chief  for  the  most  part  ,  Clinton  ,  McCain  and  Obama  offering  are  offered  relatively  subdued  performance  probably  because  questioning  in  general  on  such  a  politically  dangerous  subject  is  risky  at  best  .  However  ,  the  three  did  manage  to  distinguish  themselves  from  one  another  .  McCain  ,  repeating  his  charge  that  significant  progress  has  indeed  been  made  in  Iraq  .  Clinton  countering  Katerina  carried  .  No  ,  there  hasn't  been  an  and  Barack  Obama  focusing  on  emphasizing  that  it's  been  a  massive  strategic  blunder  .  And  other  candidates  also  took  the  opportunity  to  address  their  campaign  trail  critics  .  McCain  ,  who  is  has  taking  taken  heat  from  the  Democrats  for  his  unwavering  support  of  the  war  ,  made  a  point  of  asking  number  of  tough  questions  meanwhile  ,  Obama  and  Clinton  ,  who  who've  have  been  pressured  by  the  conservatives  Conservatives  for  advocating  withdrawal  .  Well  Welby  they'll  ,  they  be  asked  mostly  academic  questions  today  ,  McClatchy  democratic  the  papers  neighbors  Margaret  Margarita  to  land  offers  this  Cliff  Notes  version  of  the  candidate's  candidates'  candidates  performance  she  says  .  McCain  was  quote  quoted  quite  amiable  but  somber  alternately  encouraging  and  critical  .  Clinton  ,  she  says  .  Com  calm  appointed  pointed  Obama  professorial  consensus  and  whatever  means  for  the  campaign  trail  testimony  and  questioning  yesterday  had  just  won  a  clear  result  results  .  The  only  yielding  bottom  line  on  Iraq  is  that  there  is  no  bottom  line  ,  and  that  is  something  that  will  likely  play  well  for  the  Democrats  who  have  long  been  the  party  of  discontent  .  When  it  comes  to  the  Iraq  war  .  Now  ,  less  significant  subject  we  had  head  have  backed  back  the  campaign  trail  and  to  a  look  at  the  money  .  John  McCain  yesterday  released  his  March  march  fund  raising  fundraising  details  and  ,  well  while  ,  they're  just  not  so  good  .  As  that's  I  right  15  million  dollars  was  McCain's  Hall  hall  haul  in  March  up  from  the  12  million  he  he'd  raised  in  the  previous  two  months  ,  but  it  still  lags  far  behind  ,  say  ,  Barack  Obama  ,  who  took  him  40  million  in  Mark  mark  one  other  subject  we  mentioned  last  week  that  Elizabeth  Edwards  had  and  taken  John  McCain  to  task  on  his  health  care  approach  which  she  he  criticized  as  is  vastly  inadequate  well  ,  it's  not  quite  an  endorsement  .  But  yesterday  ,  Edwards  said  that  of  the  three  candidates  .

305;213.13;Politicallunch-PoliticalLunch041008GayRightsThursdaySnack297;eng-usa;306;1016;politics;For the Thursday Snack this week, Rob looks at what the democratic candidates have to offer the gay community following a stir in the gay press.;['politics', 'election', 'news', 'obama', 'clinton', 'press', 'media', 'civil_rights']; It's  Thursday  ,  April  12008  on  nine  Robert  Willis  Ellis  ,  and  this  is  your  Thursday  Thursday's  snack  .  Welcome  back  to  political  lunch  .  Barack  Obama  has  painted  himself  in  some  ways  ,  as  the  post  racial  candidate  ,  or  at  least  that's  what  his  campaign  has  been  trying  to  achieve  .  On  the  campaign  trail  .  But  what  about  other  issues  of  discrimination  .  Recently  ,  the  The  Philadelphia  Daily  News  called  out  Obama's  for  offering  little  access  to  him  for  Game  media  outlets  .  The  paper  featured  featuring  a  the  cover  ,  which  had  a  Hillary  Clinton  interview  on  one  side  and  a  big  white  blank  space  where  Obama's  interview  would  have  been  had  how  he  agreed  to  talk  with  them  now  .  Obama  responded  immediately  by  giving  an  interview  to  The  Advocate  clarifying  the  situation  and  saying  that  ,  by  necessity  ,  his  campaign  focuses  on  national  media  .  On  a  more  general  audience  he  actually  managed  to  spin  this  as  a  compliment  to  the  gay  community  ,  saying  that  by  speaking  to  a  more  general  audience  .  He  he's  is  not  treating  you  like  any  a  special  interest  interests  that  sort  of  off  in  its  own  little  box  now  has  40  issues  .  Both  candidates  have  expressed  a  commitment  to  improving  federal  recognition  of  the  rights  conferred  by  marriage  and  civil  unions  ,  which  are  offered  in  particular  states  .  However  ,  neither  democratic  Democratic  candidate  has  been  a  real  champion  of  gay  marriage  per  se  .  Even  as  they  work  worked  toward  equal  rights  by  civil  unions  now  pressed  on  this  issue  .  Barack  Obama  did  reach  for  common  ground  with  the  Advocate  advocate  interview  ,  pointing  out  there  that  when  his  parents  were  married  marry  interracial  marriage  was  illegal  in  12  states  .  He  also  said  that  he's  ahead  of  99  percent  of  elected  officials  on  these  issues  .  I  think  the  same  can  could  probably  be  said  for  Hillary  Clinton  now  .  As  for  Clinton  ,  like  Obama  .  She's  always  been  a  proponent  of  equal  rights  for  the  gay  community  .  However  ,  the  legacy  of  Bill  Clinton  is  as  a  little  bit  more  mixed  next  .  His  is  111  campaign  was  buoyed  by  strong  support  from  the  gay  community  .  But  once  in  office  ,  there  was  a  strong  pushback  by  the  military  .  When  it  came  to  gays  openly  serving  in  the  military  ,  and  much  of  the  gay  community  felt  slighted  that  he  backed  down  from  that  flight  fight  .  In  fact  ,  there  is  still  concern  that  either  Obama  or  Clinton  could  do  the  same  and  choose  not  to  fight  for  their  cars  cause  .  Once  they  actually  get  into  the  Oval  Office  in  closing  both  the  advocate  African  Advocate  and  the  Philadelphia  Gay  News  interviews  reflect  the  personalities  of  these  two  campaigns  .  Hillary  Clinton  comes  across  as  pragmatic  reasonable  well  informed  by  years  of  professional  experience  and  well  aware  of  the  limitations  of  the  executive  branch  .  By  contrast  ,  Barack  Obama  ,  comes  across  as  idealistic  sympathetic  well  informed  by  personal  experience  and  a  hundred  hurt  by  any  political  limitations  .  That's  it  for  me  today  here  on  are  political  lunch  will  and  I  will  be  back  tomorrow  for  your  time  ten  and  in  three  thanks  for  watching  .  And  don't  forget  to  subscribe

Time  done  will  well  ,  and  then  this  is  your  political  lunch  Tuesday  snack  well  ,  local  played  lunch  large  .  Well  ,  it's  tax  day  once  again  and  in  for  the  presidential  candidates  .  That  is  a  political  opportunity  not  to  be  messed  missed  John  McCain  this  morning  sent  this  email  .  To  his  supporters  ,  commiserate  in  him  with  those  who  are  quote  polled  aggravated  or  displeased  when  we  see  how  much  of  our  hard  earned  money  goes  to  the  federal  government  .  Next  ,  of  course  ,  comes  the  kicker  quote  if  one  of  my  opponents  gets  get  elected  in  November  .  McCain  says  you  can  be  certain  your  tax  rate  will  increase  across  the  board  .  McCain  ,  then  goes  on  to  state  his  plan  for  making  the  Bush  tax  cuts  permanent  .  Those  are  in  the  same  tax  cuts  that  he  opposed  several  years  ago  ,  when  they  were  first  proposed  .  He  also  ,  incidentally  .  In  and  this  as  ,  you  know  now  ,  makes  an  appeal  for  contributions  to  his  campaign  ,  sort  of  an  odd  request  on  a  day  when  lots  of  Americans  are  already  writing  large  checks  to  that  the  federal  government  .  So  back  in  March  Barack  Obama  went  when  going  after  John  McCain  for  his  reversal  on  the  issue  of  taxes  ,  saying  quote  that  was  how  I  guess  you  you've  got  your  ticket  punched  to  be  the  Republican  nominee  he  said  of  McCain  ,  but  he  was  right  then  and  he  is  wrong  .  Now  it  is  ,  of  course  ,  not  a  sure  thing  that  taxes  will  go  up  if  a  the  Democrat  Democrats  is  elected  or  that  they  will  go  down  if  a  Republican  is  elected  for  more  on  that  we'll  will  look  today  at  those  Bush  tax  cuts  ,  they  get  a  lot  of  their  time  airtime  on  the  presidential  campaign  trail  .  But  though  it's  not  as  straightforward  as  lower  or  higher  taxes  across  the  board  .  Back  in  2001  and  2003  President  Bush  pushed  through  the  Republican  controlled  Congress  two  major  tax  reforms  that  they  were  among  the  largest  tax  cut  since  the  end  of  World  War  II  Two  read  out  up  there  with  Reagan's  tax  cuts  in  the  eighties  and  Kennedy  tax  cuts  in  83  .  The  first  major  tax  cut  confined  combined  comply  focused  focus  on  economic  growth  by  lowering  the  estate  state  tax  ,  reducing  the  tax  rate  for  the  highest  income  brackets  and  in  lowering  the  tax  rate  on  capital  gains  and  dividends  this  one's  one  obviously  benefited  the  wealthy  .  First  and  foremost  a  second  component  .  The  tax  cuts  were  designed  to  benefit  a  wider  spectrum  of  taxpayers  payers  by  creating  a  new  10  percent  tax  bracket  at  the  bottom  of  the  scale  ,  doubling  the  child  tax  credit  in  reducing  the  so  called  marriage  penalty  for  couples  filing  jointly  .  So  those  are  the  kinds  of  then  going  went  to  appreciate  that  them  .  Now  all  you  have  to  understand  why  they  were  created  in  the  first  place  .  Back  in  2000  during  George  W  Bush's  first  campaign  .  The  that  cuts  were  conceived  and  touted  as  a  way  to  return  at  what  were  then  huge  government  surpluses  to  the  taxpayers  ,  as  the  Washington  Post  notes  here  .  The  that  cuts  were  approved  in  the  midst  of  a  slight  recession  which  worsened  after  September  11th  .  And  while  the  economy  did  eventually  rebound  and  unemployment  dropped  National  Savings  also  plunged  in  a  country  racked  up  enormous  trade  and  budget  deficits  .  So  the  impact  of  the  tax  cuts  is  now  significant  topic  of  debate  when  one  well  McCain  says  he  now  supports  the  tax  cuts  because  the  economy  is  in  need  of  serious  stimulus  .  Does  it  matter  that  they  were  never  intended  for  that  purpose  .  As  the  for  rocket  Hillary  Hilary  their  opposition  to  the  Bush  tax  cuts  only  goes  so  far  .  Both  Democrats  are  in  favor  of  maintaining  the  provisions  that  benefit  lower  and  middle  income  earners  ,  but  oppose  opposed  eliminating  the  estate  tax  and  a  reduction  on  high  income  and  capital  gains  taxes  for  more  from  on  Bush  tax  cuts  and  on  all  things  tax  related  .

Obama  has  prevented  a  runaway  win  for  Clinton  and  Clinton  has  proven  that  she  she's  still  has  some  fight  left  dinner  next  there  is  the  possibility  of  a  blowout  win  for  Hillary  anything  more  than  10  points  and  she  goes  a  long  way  towards  silencing  those  critics  on  some  in  her  own  party  who  say  it's  time  for  her  to  take  a  vow  never  to  come  out  on  top  in  the  delegate  count  Hillary  still  needs  to  win  by  at  least  10  points  in  every  remaining  contest  ,  and  she  also  needs  to  lock  in  70  percent  of  the  remaining  uncommitted  superdelegates  .  So  finally  ,  a  the  third  option  .  Tomorrow  is  the  possibility  of  an  Obama  upset  if  Obama  takes  home  more  delegates  than  Clinton  tomorrow  more  pledged  delegates  ,  that  is  ,  it  will  be  almost  impossible  ,  mathematically  speaking  for  Hillary  to  go  to  the  convention  with  a  convincing  case  so  you  can  expect  the  cost  of  come  out  loud  and  clear  for  Hillary  to  exit  stage  left  .  If  she  loses  Pennsylvania  again  .  It's  very  unlikely  but  stranger  things  have  happened  over  the  weekend  .  The  candidates  were  campaigning  with  all  they  had  across  the  Keystone  State  Clinton  yesterday  was  playing  to  a  crowd  that  is  usually  considered  Obama  friendly  she  outlined  a  plan  to  expand  access  to  higher  education  .  Before  a  crowd  of  25  hundred  students  and  supporters  at  the  University  of  Pennsylvania  two  nights  before  that  .  At  and  a  rally  across  the  state  .  In  Philadelphia  ,  Obama  drew  a  record  crowd  35000  people  for  a  rally  at  the  city's  Independence  Visitors  Visitor  Center  Centre  where  he  declared  his  quote  independence  from  the  politics  of  the  past  .  Over  the  course  of  the  weekend  .  The  Obama  ,  Clinton  exchange  has  grown  increasingly  heated  first  Obama  commented  that  there  all  three  candidates  McCain  included  would  make  a  better  president  than  George  W  Bush  ,  a  sentiment  that  I  think  it's  probably  safe  to  say  most  people  maybe  be  outside  of  Crawford  ,  Texas  ,  would  probably  agree  with  but  by  Hillary  Hilary  side  opening  in  and  pounced  ,  suggesting  that  Obama  perhaps  agrees  with  McCain  on  the  Iraq  war  ,  the  economy  healthcare  care  etc  cetera  then  Obama  released  a  television  ad  criticizing  Clinton's  health  care  plan  ,  claiming  it  would  penalize  low  income  workers  who  couldn't  afford  health  insurance  .  Clinton  ,  of  course  ,  fired  right  back  with  an  ad  of  her  own  ,  accusing  Obama  of  quote  quota  quolls  native  negative  politics  and  claiming  that  his  plan  would  will  cost  too  much  and  still  leave  people  uninsured  and  finally  on  Sunday  one  last  negative  ad  admitted  ads  made  it  onto  on  the  airwaves  ,  this  one  from  the  DNC  the  Democratic  National  Committee  using  quotes  from  John  McCain  was  saying  that  we  we're  are  all  better  off  than  we  were  before  the  George  W  Bush  presidency  .  The  ad  asks  voters  buyers  do  you  feel  better  off  .  So  what  when  we  learned  over  the  last  six  weeks  .  We've  said  it  before  and  say  saving  again  and  .  Momentum  is  the  hardest  thing  to  maintain  in  politics  .  Hillary  Clinton  has  proven  that  she  can  do  just  that  .  For  the  past  two  weeks  .  She  has  prevented  Obama  from  narrowing  current  leader  today  .  She's  even  pulling  up  out  just  slightly  with  a  seven  point  lead  .  According  to  this  CNN  poll  of  polls  .  Obama  has  proven  that  he  can  weather  the  storm  recalled  recall  report  controversy  over  his  ex  pastor  and  also  that  debate  last  week  that  nearly  everyone  agrees  was  unusually  tough  a  side  Sino  note  on  that  this  week  the  fourth  Fourth  estate  Estate  is  still  talking  about  it  .  Enter  enterprise  burn  bird  all  this  to  instantly  the  political  journalist  journalists  all  or  guard  rates  rights  of  ABC  News  in  The  the  New  Yorker  quote  seldom  has  a  large  corporation  corporations  so  heedless  loosely  Lee  inflicted  so  much  civic  scenic  damage  in  such  a  short  space  of  time  .  Obama  has  also  proven  especially  in  recent  days  that  he  can  go  on  the  offensive  without  seeming  well  particularly  offensive  .  And  that's  something  that  can  be  useful  ,  especially  in  a  general  election  contest  .  But  why  ,  after  all  ,  this  is  a  primary  so  tomorrow  .  What  does  each  candidate  need  needed  it  well  Hillary  needs  those  last  minute  decisions  those  undecided  voters  who  to  go  into  the  booth  and  make  their  case  .  At  the  last  moment  .  They  they've  have  overwhelmingly  gone  Gone  with  Clinton  in  the  past  ,  and  she'll  need  that  again  tomorrow  .  Barack  Obama  needs  to  the  new  voters  .  Much  has  been  made  of  in  voter  registration  ,  Pennsylvania  .  Hundreds  of  thousands  have  either  switch  switched  parties  are  or  registered  register  for  the  first  time  in  some  attribute  that  to  the  Obama  phenomenon  .  But  whatever  the  outcome  ,  tomorrow  we'll  will  be  right  here  with  all  the  news  you  need  as  that's  it  for  political  life  today  .  Thanks  for  watching  all  be  back  tomorrow  afternoon  for  an  update  on  the  voting  in  Pennsylvania  .  As  it  happens

Our  are  weekly  Friday  Friday's  series  of  10  news  stories  in  just  three  minutes  three  on  and  the  clock  ticking  away  number  Number  10  the  Democratic  nominee  is  likely  to  be  decided  by  the  numbers  .  The  candidate  with  the  most  delegates  pledged  and  super  Super  .  At  the  end  of  primary  will  be  the  nominee  but  what  if  one  candidate  leads  in  pledged  delegates  and  the  other  candidate  leads  the  popular  vote  well  post  Pennsylvania  Hillary  is  arguing  that  she  leads  in  the  popular  vote  .  At  this  point  she  does  doesn't  ,  and  she'll  tell  anyone  within  earshot  .  But  that's  only  if  you  count  those  controversial  votes  in  Florida  and  Michigan  ,  and  only  if  you  don't  count  those  who  voted  uncommitted  .  We  have  to  imagine  that  some  ,  if  not  most  of  those  were  votes  for  Obama  ,  who  didn't  have  his  name  on  the  ballot  .  Number  9  ,  so  Hillary  did  do  win  in  Pennsylvania  .  But  the  next  morning  .  Obama  picked  up  two  to  superdelegates  delegates  she  got  just  one  number  8  President  Bush  seems  to  be  doing  a  bit  of  campaigning  these  days  this  week  in  he  an  appearance  on  television's  Deal  or  No  Deal  joking  that  he  was  happy  to  be  anywhere  with  good  rating  but  the  audience  apparently  went  white  with  no  Dodi  deal  .

The  Charlotte  Observer  reports  that  the  Obama  has  raised  reached  42  million  in  North  Carolina  to  Clinton's  9  million  number  6  along  North  Carolina  appears  to  be  a  lock  for  Barack  Obama  is  it's  the  other  state  states  voting  on  May  6th  Indiana  ,  which  will  be  much  more  interest  as  the  political  announced  today  .  The  candidates  are  on  relatively  equal  footing  in  Indiana  .  They  continue  to  train  the  lead  leader  .  And  while  Obama  will  likely  win  the  states  state's  state  cities  series  .  Hillary  is  still  expected  to  take  away  most  of  the  state's  80  or  you're  so  rural  county  counties  number  five  yesterday  I  covered  cover  a  GOP  focused  on  Barack  Obama  currently  running  run  in  North  Carolina  .  What  well  this  seems  to  be  a  bit  of  a  trend  .  There  are  now  half  a  dozen  ads  running  right  across  the  country  .  All  sponsored  by  the  GOP  and  all  focused  on  Barack  Obama  number  4  for  .

Number  three  in  New  Orleans  yesterday  .  John  McCain  ,  try  tried  to  put  some  distance  between  the  White  House  and  in  his  campaign  saying  that  President  Bush  mishandled  the  aftermath  of  Hurricane  Katrina  so  McCain  .  I'm  just  saying  I  would  have  would've  waited  landed  my  plane  at  the  nearest  air  force  base  and  come  over  personally  number  two  in  any  primary  .  It's  always  helpful  to  find  define  finally  issues  on  which  the  candidates  are  clearly  divided  so  remember  that  then  gas  tax  summer  holiday  that  the  John  McCain  suggested  last  week  well  ,  Clinton  and  Obama  are  definitely  split  on  this  Obama  says  that  it  doesn't  guarantee  any  real  benefit  for  consumers  .

We  also  told  you  that  the  Federal  Election  Commission  or  SEC  a  had  plan  planned  to  close  a  loophole  in  McCain's  own  campaign  finance  law  that  allows  candidates  to  do  just  that  as  long  as  the  plane  is  owned  by  a  family  member  or  family  members  member's  company  .  But  here's  the  problem  .  The  FCC  FEC  .  An  independent  commission  tasked  with  enforcing  campaign  finance  laws  currently  has  just  two  members  ,  the  Commission  is  supposed  to  have  six  members  for  four  our  are  needed  need  new  to  vote  on  any  given  issue  so  with  just  too  well  these  days  .  They're  they  not  getting  much  of  anything  done  .  The  problem  is  that  ,  like  many  independent  federal  commissions  .  The  president  nominates  members  and  it's  up  to  the  Senate  to  confirm  or  deny  those  nominations  with  a  the  Republican  republican  president  and  a  Democrat  Democratic  controlled  Senate  the  president's  nominees  are  going  nowhere  fast  .  And  that  means  the  McCain  plane  issue  and  in  literally  dozens  of  other  important  campaign  finance  issues  are  simply  going  unresolved  just  yesterday  Judicial  Watch  a  nonpartisan  government  watchdog  group  filed  a  complaint  with  the  FEC  alleging  that  John  McCain  had  have  violated  the  a  law  prohibiting  campaign  contributions  from  foreign  nationals  when  he  hosted  a  fund  raising  fundraising  luncheon  at  Spencer  House  in  London  Judicial  Watch  suggests  suggest  that  the  use  of  the  space  amounts  to  an  IN  kind  contribution  from  a  foreign  entity  ,  and  that's  against  the  law  .  Several  weeks  earlier  .  The  group  launched  lodged  a  similar  complaint  against  Hillary  Clinton  ,  claiming  that  a  fund  fundraiser  raiser  ,  featuring  a  performance  by  Elton  John  was  in  violation  of  that  same  loss  since  sense  Sir  Elton  is  not  American  .  And  then  there's  political  advertising  always  a  source  sort  of  campaign  controversy  yesterday  afternoon  .  The  Republican  National  Committee  filed  a  complaint  ,  arguing  that  this  ad  featuring  John  McCain's  100  years  in  Iraq  statements  had  have  been  produced  introduced  ,  with  help  from  both  Democratic  candidates  ,  according  to  campaign  finance  law  ,  candidates  are  barred  from  working  on  advertising  that  is  paid  for  by  outside  groups  .  And  then  ,  just  a  few  days  ago  ,  the  Democratic  Congressional  Campaign  Committee  or  teacher  can't  we'll  or  see  filed  a  similar  complaint  ,  arguing  that  the  Republican  National  Committee  had  coordinated  with  a  it  5  27  at  call  core  freedom's  watch  to  two  run  advertising  in  Louisiana  .  In  a  few  months  ago  .  You  might  remember  that  John  McCain's  McCain  under  fire  for  not  adhering  to  primary  campaign  spending  limits  required  of  candidates  who  are  in  federal  matching  funds  program  while  one  why  McCain  campaign  claims  to  have  followed  follow  the  law  on  now  .  In  and  the  complaint  is  still  outstanding  ,  and  we're  not  talking  about  a  possible  minor  infraction  here  if  is  McCain  did  violate  the  law  a  law  that  he  himself  wrote  ,  he  would  face  significant  fines  possible  jail  time  in  a  any  certain  end  to  his  campaign  .  But  with  no  FEC  quorum  .  The  to  complaints  continue  continued  to  pile  up  .  Yesterday  ,  another  nonpartisan  non  government  watchdog  group  the  Citizens  for  Responsibility  and  Ethics  in  Washington  launched  a  campaign  to  drive  attention  to  the  lack  of  a  functioning  at  every  the  seat  sea  .  The  hold  holdup  up  ,  apparently  ,  is  a  Bush  nominee  named  Heinz  Khan's  von  bonds  but  spur  Kospi  costly  possibly  using  he's  controversial  former  Department  of  Justice  official  who  is  was  accused  by  his  peers  of  politicizing  the  justice  Justice  department's  Department's  rulings  on  voting  issues  .  There  are  also  three  other  nominees  who  would  likely  win  Senate  confirmation  and  ,  if  approved  ,  the  FEC  FTC  could  get  back  to  work  but  Senate  Republicans  led  by  Mitch  McConnell  are  R  sticking  with  the  bonds  because  he  nomination  and  they're  insisting  that  all  four  nominees  get  approved  or  denied  .  As  a  group  .  So  it's  a  somewhat  confusing  the  but  a  very  important  issue  .  You  can  learn  more  about  the  work  of  the  Federal  federal  Election  election  Commission  commission  at  FEC  FTC  that  back  down  and  then  you  can  have  your  say  on  the  this  stalemate  at  fix  fixed  the  FEC  FTC  or  roar  borrower  as  if  their  your  political  last  Tuesday  Tuesday's  snack  Robert  Robin  rather  Rob  IRA  higher  back  here  tomorrow  we'll  see  you  there  CNN  .

Now  ,  as  Michigan  Democratic  National  Committee  member  Debbie  Dingell  told  MSNBC  this  morning  .  Everybody  everybody's  is  in  a  rush  to  get  this  done  .  She'd  like  to  see  the  election  playing  play  out  ,  since  there  they  are  only  six  weeks  left  ,  and  she  expects  that  the  voters  will  benefit  by  having  a  the  chance  to  meet  the  candidates  in  their  own  states  .  Now  ,  of  course  ,  this  may  sound  like  a  Clinton  campaign  talking  points  and  that's  probably  because  this  woman  has  publicly  endorsed  Clinton  in  the  past  .  However  ,  she  did  stress  that  this  is  a  compromise  solution  and  by  the  look  of  things  this  morning  .  It's  not  really  making  anybody  especially  happy  ,  but  at  least  it  is  a  move  forward  .  The  plan  does  take  into  account  those  uncommitted  votes  which  many  say  would  have  gone  to  Barack  Obama  had  he  been  on  the  ballot  in  Michigan  and  certainly  at  least  they  were  anti  Hillary  votes  .  But  after  months  of  the  Clinton  argument  ,  saying  that  the  Clinton  wine  and  that  those  uncommitted  votes  shouldn't  go  to  anybody  .  Well  ,  I'm  starting  to  wonder  why  Clinton  gave  him  and  reach  this  compromise  at  all  .  But  regardless  ,  this  hard  won  compromise  does  at  least  mean  that  hopefully  I  won't  have  to  go  through  this  whole  report  process  again  .  But  what  does  it  mean  for  the  actual  numbers  .  Well  swell  ,  we  obviously  need  to  give  Clinton  another  10  pledged  pledge  delegates  in  the  final  .  Now  ,  but  the  math  map  matter  is  still  looking  very  challenging  for  the  Clinton  campaign  to  get  a  good  look  at  what  both  candidates  are  facing  during  this  final  stretch  .  Visit  the  New  York  Times  website  and  check  out  their  delegate  calculator  .  This  is  probably  the  best  tool  I've  seen  seem  to  really  understand  the  odds  for  both  candidates  ,  and  it  demonstrates  why  Clinton  isn't  throwing  in  the  tally  it  yet  if  Clinton  were  ,  on  average  ,  to  two  win  we  the  will  last  six  contests  with  about  54  percent  of  the  vote  .  She  would  will  also  need  to  win  75  percent  of  the  remaining  superdelegates  she  did  win  those  states  with  54  percent  .  Well  ,  it  might  not  be  very  hard  for  her  to  win  over  three  quarters  of  the  remaining  super  Super  is  as  meanwhile  if  Barack  Obama  were  to  win  those  states  with  54  percent  well  he  would  only  need  to  convince  18  percent  of  the  remaining  superdelegates  to  come  to  his  side  now  .  Obviously  ,  if  the  Michigan  deal  does  doesn't  work  out  of  the  DNC  approves  it  .  At  the  end  of  this  month  that  does  change  the  map  on  this  calculator  ,  a  little  bit  .  There  they  are  now  another  29  super  delegates  in  play  ,  and  it  could  be  that  this  Michigan  deal  actually  determines  the  final  outcome  .  Well  ,  that's  it  for  me  .  Today  ,  thanks  very  much  for  watching  political  lunch  I'm  on  back  here  tomorrow  with  well  for  your  weekly  10  and  three

Despite  the  beautiful  spring  weather  today  this  morning  was  dark  and  stormy  for  the  McCain  campaign  courtesy  of  this  guy  is  Bob  Barr  ,  a  former  Republican  congressman  from  Georgia  who  announced  this  morning  that  he'll  be  seeking  the  Libertarian  Party's  nomination  for  the  presidency  .  Does  he  have  a  shot  .  Well  ,  no  way  .  But  he  it  does  have  a  very  good  opportunity  to  spend  the  next  few  months  ,  saying  things  like  this  when  asked  this  morning  to  describe  the  ways  in  which  he  disagrees  with  John  McCain  bar  Barr  Bar  respondents  responded  how  much  time  do  we  have  .  So  why  the  US  has  a  good  shot  at  playing  plainly  the  Ralph  Nader  role  in  reverse  .  This  will  be  a  close  election  and  even  a  if  bar  Barr  manages  managers  to  take  a  percentage  point  or  two  away  from  John  McCain  .  Well  ,  that  could  make  all  the  difference  .  Argentina  ushered  Congress  congress  during  the  so  called  Republican  revolution  Revolution  in  113  more  bar  quickly  made  a  name  for  himself  on  the  Hallmark  hallmark  conservative  issues  ,  making  gun  rights  rates  staunch  vocal  opposition  to  abortion  ,  a  hatred  for  the  IRS  in  and  a  his  strong  supporter  support  of  the  war  on  drugs  .  The  bar  platform  bar  Barr  also  offered  offer  the  Defense  of  Marriage  Act  which  states  that  only  all  marriages  that  are  between  a  man  and  a  woman  can  be  federally  recognized  .  But  he  does  not  support  the  federal  marriage  amendment  which  would  define  marriage  in  the  US  as  only  between  a  man  and  a  woman  .  He  cites  states  States'  rights  issues  for  his  opposition  to  that  you  might  also  remember  Bob  Barr  from  for  his  role  leading  the  impeachment  fight  against  Bill  Clinton  .  But  let  let's  lets  me  mean  and  Bob  Barr  more  ,  the  than  2008  edition  ,  for  obvious  reasons  bars  now  remaking  himself  in  the  image  of  a  libertarian  viewpoints  he  .  The  to  big  government  and  big  spending  is  the  root  of  all  problems  he  opposes  a  national  health  care  plan  .  He  makes  border  security  a  top  priority  ,  and  he  wants  to  bring  the  troops  home  from  Iraq  ,  saying  their  military  should  be  used  for  national  defense  in  2000  to  two  bar  spoke  out  strongly  against  the  Bush  administration's  post  20  encroachments  encroachment  on  privacy  and  other  civil  liberties  that  earned  him  a  foot  in  the  door  with  the  Libertarian  Party  .  But  here's  the  interesting  part  bar  Barr  ,  lost  his  seat  in  Congress  in  2003  ,  in  part  because  the  Libertarian  Party  was  running  ads  against  him  .  Barr  Moore  was  one  of  the  most  vocal  proponents  of  the  war  on  drugs  ,  something  that  the  libertarian  strongly  oppose  so  apparently  now  he's  made  amends  with  the  libertarians  .  You  can  imagine  that  he  would  only  make  this  his  announcement  today  .  If  you  he  had  some  shot  at  getting  their  nomination  for  the  presidency  .  So  again  by  bar  has  little  chance  of  actually  getting  into  the  Oval  Office  but  he  will  likely  have  an  impact  on  the  race  .  Some  have  said  John  McCain  has  been  getting  a  free  pass  in  recent  months  as  the  press  has  focused  on  the  Democratic  democratic  nomination  fight  Bob  Barr  ,  it  appears  ,  is  determined  to  change  that  .  That's  as  it  for  from  political  life  ,  so  they  will  be  back  tomorrow  with  the  results  from  today's  primary  in  West  Virginia  ,  and  also  we'll  take  a  look  at  a  new  issue  on  the  campaign  trail  veterans  veterans'  rights  rates  .  Any  and  attempts  to  pass  a  20  century  GI  Bill  bill  thanks  for  watching  we'll  see  tomorrow  . 
314;225.08;Politicallunch-PoliticalLunch052708875;eng-usa;315;1016;politics;"For today&apos;s Tuesday Snack, Will looks at the role of lobbyists in the presidential campaigns. Is John McCain&apos;s new crackdown just smoke and mirrors? Has Barack Obama stuck with his pledge to refuse lobbyist money?";['obama', 'mccain', 'clinton', 'politics', 'political_lunch']; It's  Tuesday  May  27  done  well  and  in  this  is  your  political  lunch  launched  Tuesday  snack  welcome  back  today  on  political  life  lines  lunch  you  your  you're  Tuesday  stack  sack  is  all  about  lobbyists  and  the  presidential  candidates  making  their  home  on  Washington's  K  Street  lobbyists  are  or  a  curious  Bellway  commodity  .  Their  job  is  simple  they  get  paid  to  advance  their  clients'  clients  agenda  in  the  halls  of  power  from  the  defense  industry  to  the  AARP  ,  the  governments  government's  of  have  just  about  everywhere  .  Someone  in  Washington  is  being  paid  to  advance  their  interests  .  You  may  recall  that  last  week  we  mentioned  John  McCain's  new  policy  banning  active  at  lobbyists  from  working  for  his  campaign  .  The  new  policy  was  in  response  to  press  reports  ,  the  two  McCain  staffers  works  worked  for  a  lobbying  firm  retained  by  the  not  so  friendly  military  junta  in  Myanmar  so  McCain  announced  a  the  new  policy  prohibiting  lobbyists  from  working  for  his  campaign  and  since  then  five  more  staffers  have  been  shown  the  door  ,  including  finance  Finance  chairman  Chairman  Tom  Laufer  ,  who  have  had  lobbied  for  Saudi  Arabia  Laufer  Lauffer  ,  told  the  press  that  he  never  discussed  his  lobbying  clients  with  Senator  McCain  but  lobbying  disclosure  records  tell  a  different  story  .  In  2006  Laufer  hosts  hosted  hosting  a  meeting  between  McCain  and  the  Saudi  ambassador  so  Laufer  ,  and  a  few  others  have  haven't  been  shown  the  door  .  But  the  new  policy  is  less  serious  than  it  might  seem  ,  there  are  plenty  of  loopholes  that  allow  staffers  who  are  either  retired  or  on  leave  from  their  lobbying  jobs  to  keep  their  campaign  jobs  take  Charlie  Black  ,  for  instance  ,  who  is  was  McCain's  chief  political  adviser  advisor  and  widely  regarded  as  one  of  the  most  influential  DC  power  brokers  lacks  last  lax  client  list  was  a  who's  who  of  foreign  dictators  including  Fernand  Myanmar  Marcos  and  Mobutu  says  sets  they  say  go  Go  ,  but  since  he  retired  from  his  lobbying  job  before  joining  the  McCain  campaign  he  can  stay  ,  according  to  the  new  policy  known  they're  then  as  Rick  Davis  McCain's  campaign  manager  and  the  one  who  announced  the  lobbyists  lobbyist  crackdown  he's  he  currently  on  leave  from  his  job  as  a  defense  industry  lobbyist  .  So  is  this  new  policy  anything  any  more  than  just  a  hollow  gesture  .  While  well  wealth  not  surprisingly  ,  Barack  Obama  doesn't  think  so  .  He's  used  the  episode  to  question  why  McCain  has  employed  lobbies  in  the  first  place  .  Especially  since  McCain  himself  in  the  mid  nineties  authored  a  bill  that  would  have  made  it  illegal  for  campaigns  to  do  just  that  .  McCain  is  has  trying  tried  to  market  himself  as  a  Washington  maverick  not  susceptible  to  the  usual  ways  of  Beltway  politics  .  But  the  facts  in  this  case  ,  tell  a  different  story  .  But  what  we're  I'm  are  not  Barack  Obama  .  From  the  earliest  days  of  his  campaign  .  His  pledge  to  refuse  contributions  from  lobbyists  .  But  what  about  those  who  work  worked  for  lobbyists  date  today  .  Obama  has  raised  just  under  2.5  million  from  the  employees  of  law  firms  that  also  do  lobbying  work  in  and  Wal  Wall  wall  Obama  hasn't  taken  any  money  directly  from  lobbyists  .  He  has  paid  a  few  of  them  to  advise  revise  his  campaign  just  like  John  McCain  ,  now  there's  is  Hillary  Clinton  .  The  departure  of  her  chief  strategist  ,  Mark  Penn  was  probably  the  most  widely  publicized  episode  only  a  lobbyist  lobbyists  staffer  Stafford  staff  being  been  shown  the  door  that  that's  after  it  was  revealed  .  The  that  a  plan  pan  was  lobbying  on  behalf  of  the  Colombian  government  to  promote  a  trade  agreement  which  Clinton  opposed  .  So  what's  the  bottom  line  .  All  three  presidential  candidates  have  have  had  lobbyists  on  the  payroll  and  Clinton  and  McCain  continued  continue  to  accept  campaign  cash  from  lobbyists  for  more  on  the  role  lobbyists  any  presidential  candidates  .

Today  we  have  two  more  political  party  conventions  that  changed  history  ,  as  has  compiled  in  the  latest  issue  of  Smithsonian  magazine  Magazine  last  week  ,  recovered  we  31  .  The  attempted  resurrection  of  Teddy  Roosevelt  in  67  Truman's  triumph  and  the  Democrats  split  over  civil  rights  .  Today  they  we  would  start  in  83  .  At  the  Republican  convention  Convention  at  the  Cow  Palace  in  San  Francisco  .  Lyndon  Johnson  is  ,  of  course  ,  the  Democratic  democratic  president  having  assumed  assume  the  office  less  than  a  year  before  following  the  assassination  of  John  F  Kennedy  ,  Johnson  has  successfully  associated  himself  with  Kennedy's  popularity  on  the  Republican  side  of  the  aisle  .  In  83  ,  became  a  year  in  which  the  party's  parties  two  factions  .  The  conservatives  Conservatives  and  the  any  moderate  liberals  Liberals  finally  had  handed  out  for  years  ,  the  that  my  mire  Republicans  found  bound  largely  in  the  northeast  Northeast  defeated  a  the  conservative  Republican  primary  candidates  .  But  in  83  Barry  Goldwater  ,  a  conservative  Republican  from  Arizona  won  one  the  majority  of  primary  votes  although  Cold  war  War  was  more  or  less  assured  to  win  the  nomination  .  The  64  convention  still  went  down  as  one  of  the  most  beer  in  modern  history  .  GOP  moderates  and  in  the  Conservatives  openly  expressed  their  contempt  for  each  other  .  Nelson  Rockefeller  ,  governor  of  New  York  and  a  moderate  challenger  to  Goldwater  was  loudly  booed  when  he  addressed  the  convention  .  Former  senator  Senator  William  Scranton  mounted  a  late  charge  against  water  Goldwater  and  ,  according  to  polls  ,  screen  Scranton  didn't  did  win  a  majority  of  support  from  Republicans  but  this  was  only  after  the  primaries  had  concluded  Goldwater  was  himself  at  times  his  own  worst  enemy  ,  he  told  a  German  magazine  that  if  elected  he  he'd  tell  generals  in  Vietnam  ,  quote  ,  fellas  as  .  We  made  the  decision  to  now  it's  your  problem  Goldwater  War  was  cantankerous  .  He  was  antagonistic  towards  the  Soviets  and  he  was  reluctant  to  embrace  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  83  .  In  the  end  ,  despite  Goldwater's  emerging  extremism  and  plummeting  popularity  ,  the  delegates  sent  to  the  conventions  convention's  from  states  that  have  had  voted  for  bowl  Paul  war  or  in  the  primaries  held  true  to  their  word  or  all  war  War  was  nominated  in  again  with  the  Republican  Party  still  badly  divided  .  He  you  went  on  want  to  lose  the  general  election  to  Lyndon  Johnson  .  In  one  of  the  most  lopsided  general  election  contests  in  American  history  .  Four  forty  years  later  in  87  .  It  was  the  Democrats'  Democrats  turn  for  disaster  .  The  convention  was  held  in  Chicago  ,  the  this  seat  of  political  power  in  the  sixty  second  only  to  Washington  ,  DC  .  From  the  start  .  Everything  looked  look  bad  .

Of  course  these  preparations  were  for  the  influx  of  protesters  from  across  the  nation  who  came  to  Chicago  to  protest  the  Vietnam  War  the  term  that  year  ,  appropriately  enough  ,  was  create  change  .

That's  the  website  for  the  Commission  on  Presidential  Debates  they've  they  run  every  presidential  debates  has  107  .  But  don't  expect  much  until  a  couple  weeks  ago  that  Wednesday  haven't  hadn't  been  updated  in  nearly  a  year  .  Other  important  dates  to  remember  in  the  next  two  months  ,  had  have  to  do  with  fund  raising  fundraising  last  month  .  The  McCain  campaign  had  its  best  month  on  record  ,  bringing  in  47  million  dollars  now  we  haven't  yet  learned  Obama's  total  for  the  month  of  August  .  But  they  too  to  say  was  a  banner  month  however  things  think  now  have  had  changed  when  it  comes  to  campaign  financing  with  the  a  general  election  underway  under  .  The  McCain  campaign  is  now  under  the  public  funding  system  on  September  5th  .  The  McCain  campaign  happily  accepted  a  check  for  84.1  million  dollars  in  public  funds  ,  courtesy  of  the  American  taxpayers  taxpayer  .  But  that's  it  for  them  .  Between  now  and  November  .  Now  at  the  Obama  campaign  ,  meanwhile  ,  has  opted  out  of  that  their  public  financing  system  ,  so  they'll  have  to  continue  to  rely  on  private  contributions  .  So  far  there  have  been  shattered  all  fund  raising  fundraising  records  and  the  assumption  is  that  they  will  continue  to  do  so  .  But  we'll  have  to  wait  until  the  first  two  weeks  of  October  to  learn  whether  or  not  that  gamble  will  pay  off  .  If  Obama  can  raise  equal  to  or  more  than  the  amount  McCain  takes  on  a  public  finding  funding  well  and  that  then  Obama  will  be  sitting  pretty  as  he  will  won't  be  held  to  the  a  spending  restrictions  that  come  with  public  financing  again  .  We  won't  know  until  October  ,  but  until  then  ,  the  Obama  campaign's  campaign  finance  team  is  certainly  in  the  hot  seat  finally  today  they  on  your  list  of  important  dates  to  remember  .

318;310.47;Politicallunch-PoliticalLunch092308150StrategySnack991;eng-usa;319;1016;politics;For your Snack, Rob introduces the highly effective 150 Strategy and looks at its impact on the campaign trail, from John McCain all the way back to John Adams.;['politics', 'election', 'news', 'media', 'mccain', 'politicallunch']; It's  Tuesday  ,  September  20  on  I'm  Robert  with  your  Tuesday  snack  and  today  on  the  lunch  launch  lies  ,  damn  lies  and  the  one  fifty  strategy  ,  welcome  back  mat  political  lunch  .  Today's  today  show  is  focused  on  a  tactic  which  many  think  thanks  that  there  Karl  Rove  probably  invented  but  which  in  fact  has  been  used  by  everyone  from  John  Hancock  to  James  Carville  and  the  basic  idea  is  this  you  tell  a  small  line  light  which  is  grounded  in  some  truth  then  taken  take  so  far  to  the  extreme  .  But  many  lesser  lights  lives  wines  lies  .  Well  ,  they  seem  reasonable  and  very  believable  and  nobody's  come  up  with  a  decent  turn  turned  for  this  so  I  call  it  at  the  one  fifty  strategy  basically  you  take  something  that's  maybe  50  percent  true  and  50  percent  %  believable  you  claim  claimed  that  its  one  hundred  and  fifty  percent  %  true  through  and  ,  well  ,  then  it  feels  a  hundred  percent  true  to  demonstrate  this  yesterday  McCain's  top  adviser  Steve  Schmidt  told  reporters  that  quote  ,  whatever  the  New  York  Times  once  was  ,  it  is  today  .  Not  by  any  standard  in  a  journalistic  organization  obviously  an  absurd  statement  .  He  then  went  on  to  say  that  the  Times  was  quote  quoted  115  percent  %  in  the  tank  for  the  Democratic  democratic  candidate  is  that  there  one  fifty  .  I  was  is  talking  about  .  So  is  that  part  of  Serb  service  Serbia  is  a  life  lot  or  is  it  just  an  embellishment  .  Well  ,  let's  start  with  the  truth  of  our  equation  here  New  York  Times  editorial  board  is  certainly  not  considered  consider  to  be  especially  conservative  and  certainly  when  compared  with  other  New  York  City  papers  like  said  say  a  the  Wall  Street  Journal  the  The  Daily  News  The  the  Daily  Post  The  the  New  York  Sun  well  while  the  New  York  Times  does  seem  very  liberal  by  comparison  ,  if  only  because  they're  not  now  asserting  a  conservative  perspective  the  way  some  of  these  his  other  papers  do  let's  take  this  assumption  and  apply  using  my  tour  tool  here  ,  which  is  the  a  subject  subjective  of  an  entirely  non  scientific  gauge  of  what  is  believable  ,  and  what  is  absurd  .  The  red  ready  indicates  just  how  absurdly  absurd  comment  is  the  not  no  balloon  blue  tells  you  how  believable  Indians  after  the  fact  in  this  case  100  percent  indicates  the  The  Edge  edge  of  Reality  reality  pass  past  that  you  get  in  into  flying  elephants  and  a  black  holes  and  in  things  now  .  What  we  said  that  the  Times  had  in  liberal  perspective  .  Well  ,  that's  about  50  percent  %  their  there  50  percent  %  true  and  50  percent  believable  .  What  we  said  that  influenced  the  way  that  reporters  and  editors  cover  however  stories  .  What's  published  every  day  .  Well  ,  the  assertion  is  a  little  bit  of  serving  certain  and  skeptics  sceptics  will  of  course  be  somewhat  doubtful  of  that  ,  but  it  is  still  relatively  believable  ,  so  maybe  that  one  goes  to  60  percent  on  the  believe  ability  abilities  scale  then  if  we  suggest  suggested  a  Steve  Schmidt  Smith  did  that  the  The  Times  is  so  biased  ,  but  that  it's  not  even  a  really  Aurelio  a  newspaper  immoral  anymore  that  obviously  goes  behind  reality  to  a  hundred  and  fifty  percent  %  somewhere  in  the  eighth  eight  dimension  skeptics  sceptics  ,  of  course  ,  will  we'll  say  that's  ridiculous  ,  of  course  ,  there  there's  still  a  news  organization  .  But  what's  happened  is  that  the  debate  has  now  been  framed  inflamed  flamed  by  Steve  Schmidt  ,  instead  of  debating  whether  or  not  the  Times  is  biased  isn't  is  actually  a  news  organization  .  Or  has  it  become  so  biased  that  then  it  doesn't  even  compare  to  other  news  organizations  to  two  to  the  one  fifty  strategies  strategy  sets  set  up  of  a  premise  is  apprentice  so  extreme  that  in  order  to  challenging  inane  any  debate  be  really  must  rest  on  how  the  next  most  reasonable  France  practice  .  Let's  try  this  with  another  example  .  Remember  John  Kerry  well  .  John  Kerry  is  as  a  liberal  war  hero  .  That's  50  percent  John  Kerry  is  extremely  liberal  and  not  the  a  hero  euro  .  He  claims  to  be  at  70  percent  now  John  Kerry  lied  about  everything  he  did  in  the  war  ,  and  in  fact  wants  to  lose  a  war  for  his  own  greedy  purposes  so  absurd  that  it  makes  any  lesser  attacks  seem  almost  reasonable  and  ,  perhaps  more  than  any  other  thing  .  This  is  what  cost  John  Kerry  .  The  election  in  2000  and  4  .  And  now  if  you  want  will  wanna  to  see  just  how  long  this  has  been  an  in  plan  play  .  Let's  go  back  to  President  John  Quincy  Adams  and  Andrew  Jackson  and  Jackson  had  have  been  saying  that  Adams  was  not  immoral  moral  thing  here  you're  and  in  throwing  a  few  attacks  taxes  way  on  that  ,  but  nothing  that  really  gained  gain  traction  than  then  in  an  inventory  of  White  House  for  furniture  injury  injuries  ,  including  included  a  pool  table  and  chairs  set  Andrew  Jackson  suggested  that  Adams  had  filled  the  White  House  with  gambling  ,  furniture  and  turned  turn  the  a  joint  into  a  gambling  den  .  And  ,  of  course  ,  that  wasn't  entirely  absurd  but  it  made  any  lesser  accusations  seem  completely  reasonable  .  So  keep  your  eyes  and  ears  open  41  ,  50  strategy  in  these  final  weeks  and  don't  get  played  by  either  side  .  That's  it  for  me  today  here  political  lunch  ,  come  back  and  join  me  tomorrow  and  ,  in  fact  ,  don't  miss  a  single  that  was  owned  when  by  I  going  go  to  into  political  livestock  star  common  Carmen  subscribing  .  Right  now  ,  thanks  for  watching  Aussie  tomorrow  .

Who&apos;s fault was it, and is anyone (on ""Main Street"") really that broken up about it? ALSO: Have you heard about this ""Great Schlep""?";['political_lunch', 'politics', 'obama', 'mccain', 'palin', 'biden', 'economy', 'clinton']; It's  Tuesday  September  30th  on  your  political  last  Tuesday  Tuesday's  ,  snapped  snap  snack  .  They  it  will  take  a  look  at  the  bailout  out  bill  blame  game  and  the  the  great  schlep  welcome  but  back  to  political  lunch  for  snack  snacks  in  a  couple  of  news  new  stories  and  then  some  lighter  fare  ,  you're  you'll  you  probably  needed  considering  yesterday's  news  that  the  US  House  of  Representatives  has  voted  against  the  700  billion  dollar  bailout  bail  bill  and  in  Wall  Street  responded  with  a  seven  hundred  point  drop  in  the  Dow  today  on  the  campaign  trail  .  Everyone's  playing  the  blame  game  .  John  McCain  says  that  the  Democrats  and  Barack  Obama  injected  injecting  unnecessary  partisanship  into  the  negotiations  while  Barack  Obama  spokesman  Bill  Burton  got  down  a  little  bit  more  specific  criticizing  John  McCain  for  going  out  on  a  double  date  on  Saturday  night  at  a  fancy  DC  restaurant  with  Joe  Lieberman  and  his  wife  ,  while  the  ill  fated  deal  was  being  negotiated  on  Capitol  Hill  .  At  the  end  the  day  neither  candidate  and  that  much  to  do  with  the  failure  of  the  bailout  bill  since  sense  this  was  a  vote  in  the  House  house  and  they  are  both  senators  .  Furthermore  ,  there  is  increasing  political  risk  when  it  comes  to  the  idea  of  a  bailout  .  On  the  a  whole  ,  as  more  people  question  the  necessity  of  the  a  Wall  Street  rescue  package  of  tax  payers'  expense  .  The  candidates  Kennedys  have  less  and  less  to  gain  by  blaming  each  other  for  yesterday's  failure  today  .  Barack  Obama  ,  perhaps  ,  acknowledging  that  the  Main  main  Street  street  is  increasingly  skeptical  of  writing  rain  such  a  large  check  to  Wall  Street  .  He  suggested  strengthening  the  federal  insurance  program  that  protects  the  savings  of  the  average  person  or  small  business  currently  bank  deposits  of  up  two  hundred  thousand  dollars  or  insured  by  the  FDIC  program  that's  a  the  limit  that  it  hasn't  been  updated  in  28  years  Obama  now  proposes  increasing  that  to  250000  dollars  of  insurance  ,  a  move  he  says  will  increase  economic  confidence  and  ensure  that  the  economic  bailout  doesn't  just  turn  turned  into  another  opportunity  for  the  rich  to  get  richer  .  McCain  ,  meanwhile  ,  is  suggesting  that  the  700  dollar  bailout  package  should  be  re  branded  from  bailout  to  rescue  on  CNN's  American  Morning  McCain  today  they  said  let's  not  call  it  a  bailout  .  Let's  call  it  a  rescue  because  it  is  a  rescue  .  It  is  a  rescue  of  Main  Street  America  McCain  went  on  to  say  that  the  Congress  has  so  far  failed  to  convince  most  of  America  that  the  The  Wall  Street  package  is  in  isn't  the  average  taxpayers  payers  taxpayer's  taxpayers'  best  interests  .  Also  on  today  Saturday  ,  on  the  campaign  trail  its  it's  TV  ads  galore  .  John  McCain  has  a  new  ad  featuring  remarks  from  former  president  Bill  Clinton  .  He  said  that  democratic  resistance  in  Congress  was  generally  the  to  blame  blamed  for  the  lack  of  regulation  for  Fannie  Mae  and  Freddie  Mac  during  the  Clinton  presidency  .  Barack  Obama's  latest  but  spot  also  focuses  on  the  economy  .  It  is  a  two  minute  straight  to  camera  monologue  about  his  proposals  for  tax  code  reform  to  help  small  businesses  and  middle  class  families  and  the  elderly  .  And  ,  of  course  ,  the  Republican  National  Committee  has  a  response  ad  claiming  once  again  that  Barack  Obama's  plan  announced  two  a  new  taxes  ,  new  spending  and  more  debt  and  it  that  is  all  that  can  be  downright  depressing  .  Finally  ,  today  ,  the  great  schlep  I  and  Barack  Obama  doesn't  become  the  next  president  of  the  United  States  and  I  blamed  blame  the  did  you  years  jeers  I  am  and  ,  I  then  know  you're  saying  like  only  got  very  camp  leaders  saying  this  Tuesday  ,  the  most  liberal  scrappy  civil  still  rates  rights  .  The  people  there  are  I  ,  yes  ,  that's  true  .  You're  forgetting  of  small  large  larger  group  of  Jews  that  are  not  that  way  and  go  by  several  Elliot  Elliott  Eliot  Mrs.  misses  answers  .

John  McCain  and  Barack  Obama  of  playing  in  the  mud  .  But  Paul  polls  shifting  with  each  passing  day  .  We  will  return  to  what  was  just  a  year  or  so  ago  .  The  top  issue  on  voters'  minds  if  you  guessed  guess  the  war  in  Iraq  .  Your  correct  tonight  McCain  and  Obama  me  for  four  in  town  hall  style  debate  and  hopefully  you'll  hear  more  from  them  about  their  plans  for  US  engagement  in  Iraq  .  After  all  ,  we've  we  heard  little  on  that  subject  .  During  the  first  presidential  debate  last  month  ,  even  you  though  know  that  one  was  supposed  to  focus  on  foreign  policy  on  the  subject  of  Iraq  in  the  next  chief  executive  will  be  able  to  exert  a  significant  amount  of  influence  when  it  comes  to  the  economy  or  housing  market  ,  where  or  the  health  healthcare  care  Nasser  master  .

But  when  it  comes  to  the  use  of  our  military  the  responsibility  there  their  lies  squarely  in  the  Oval  Office  .  So  what  will  Barack  Obama  or  John  McCain  do  about  Iraq  .  If  elected  ,  and  more  specifically  ,  what  will  would  they  do  differently  .  The  question  has  presented  more  specifically  in  that  article  from  yesterday's  New  York  Times  is  how  will  the  next  president  build  on  current  gains  in  Iraqi  stability  while  also  drawing  down  the  number  of  US  troops  on  that  question  .  McCain  and  Obama  have  had  very  different  answers  General  .  David  Petraeus  ,  the  a  former  top  general  in  Iraq  will  soon  be  in  charge  of  all  US  commitments  in  the  Middle  East  and  Afghanistan  has  said  that  he  needs  quote  maximum  flexibility  when  it  comes  to  troop  withdrawal  .  Obama  ,  who  has  frequently  cited  the  need  for  more  US  troops  in  Afghanistan  ,  pushed  back  on  at  making  the  case  that  Iraq  should  no  longer  take  priority  over  Afghanistan  .  John  McCain  ,  who  has  long  insisted  that  Iraq  is  the  central  front  in  the  war  on  terror  said  he'd  he  give  Petraeus  whatever  flexibility  he  needed  when  it  comes  to  maintain  a  troop  presence  in  Iraq  ,  even  if  that  means  continuing  a  nimble  commitment  in  Afghanistan  there  is  your  you  properly  .  A  draft  accord  between  Iraqi  and  US  governments  that  includes  a  rough  three  year  deadline  for  withdrawal  of  all  US  troops  from  Iraq  .  Barack  Obama's  call  for  withdrawing  troops  within  16  months  far  for  .  It  seems  exceeds  that  ,  while  what  well  John  McCain  has  at  times  objected  to  both  Obama's  goal  and  the  current  US  Iraqi  agreement  McCain  argues  that  preserving  gains  made  under  the  so  called  surge  is  the  most  pressing  need  something  Obama  addresses  with  his  plan  to  maintain  some  type  of  residual  force  in  Iraq  .  Most  likely  ,  made  up  of  special  forces  units  specifically  trained  to  combat  terrorism  in  the  region  .  Then  of  course  there  is  the  question  of  Iraq's  own  ability  to  defend  itself  .  The  preparation  of  their  security  and  police  forces  ,  most  of  which  has  been  conducted  by  American  forces  in  you  know  the  times  Times  are  being  earlier  this  year  .  Obama  noted  that  the  general  who  oversaw  US  training  of  Iraqi  forces  ,  told  a  congressional  hearing  that  Iraq  could  defend  itself  by  the  fall  of  2009  ,  he  says  ,  reminds  revised  that  statement  claiming  now  .  The  that  Iraqi  forces  may  namely  need  assistance  from  the  US  through  2012  .  John  McCain's  response  will  we'll  be  there  through  2012  .  If  that's  what's  needed  .  Obama's  response  quote  quoting  quoted  far  our  benchmarks  are  contingent  on  actions  by  the  Iraqis  and  Iraqis  don't  take  them  ,  then  that  than  we  are  not  now  in  control  of  our  own  circumstances  and  our  deployments  at  some  point  we  have  we've  got  to  break  that  way  link  ,  they'll  don't  do  it  for  us  .

It's  no  secret  that  even  in  2008  .

The  issue  of  voting  machines  ,  there  isn't  much  good  news  last  week  ,  Wired  magazine  reported  that  in  Palm  Beach  County  Florida  .  That's  the  same  county  at  the  heart  of  the  Bush  V  Gore  controversy  in  2000  in  months  of  recounts  in  this  year's  primary  contests  contest  were  unable  to  produce  a  clear  winner  in  in  local  judicial  race  .  The  investigation  found  that  thousands  of  ballots  were  improperly  read  red  by  body  the  optical  scanning  machines  .  Those  that  are  the  ones  that  read  the  a  little  bubbles  that  you  fill  in  .  Thousands  more  were  lost  and  thousands  more  were  missed  counted  in  the  hand  recount  of  ballots  that  couldn't  be  read  rated  at  all  .  Worse  yet  ,  these  he's  were  worthy  the  new  machines  brought  in  to  replace  the  controversial  touchscreen  machines  that  left  no  paper  trail  those  there's  of  a  Sens  sense  been  Ben  outlawed  outlined  .

According  to  verify  verified  voting  ,  an  organization  that  promotes  election  integrity  33  states  now  have  laws  on  the  books  that  they  to  require  requires  something  called  a  in  V  V  P  or  or  voter  verified  paper  record  .

This  is  political  lunch  on  I'm  will  enforce  snack  .  Today  they  we'll  will  take  a  look  at  the  surprising  source  of  Barack  Obama's  bump  in  the  polls  .  ,  welcome  back  to  political  local  lunch  launched  Tuesday  snack  on  Sunday  ,  the  New  York  Times  Magazine  magazine  ran  this  cover  story  asking  if  Barack  Obama  could  can  win  the  support  of  white  men  man  in  the  group  .  He's  had  the  most  trouble  convincing  since  his  campaign  began  .  It  might  seem  a  little  late  in  the  game  to  be  asking  that  question  with  just  two  weeks  left  until  the  big  day  well  either  has  or  already  he  hasn't  it  .  If  Obama  didn't  start  working  on  that  problem  months  ago  .  Well  ,  then  forget  about  it  and  from  all  the  rallies  with  a  hundred  thousand  people  in  and  any  the  record  breaking  fundraising  you  might  think  that  ,  like  life  campaign  has  gotten  very  good  at  preaching  to  the  choir  ,  but  not  much  else  .  After  all  ,  Barack  Obama  is  the  candidate  who  suggested  during  the  primary  .  That  summit  disenfranchised  white  voters  cling  to  guns  and  religion  ,  a  comment  that  was  picked  up  widely  and  it  still  appears  occasionally  in  the  press  .  Obama  has  called  that  one  when  informal  fumble  explaining  quote  I  was  actually  making  the  reverse  point  clumsily  ,  which  is  that  these  voters  have  a  right  to  be  frustrated  because  they  have  been  ignored  ,  well  above  done  on  said  Democrats  in  past  decades  of  that  the  poor  job  of  reaching  out  to  white  working  class  voters  on  both  cultural  and  economic  issues  ,  and  over  the  past  few  months  ,  he's  apparently  done  a  fairly  good  job  of  doing  just  that  ,  because  yesterday  ,  one  day  after  the  New  York  Times  ran  at  that  magazine  Magazine  cover  story  Gallo  released  release  their  latest  daily  dealing  polls  and  Barack  Obama  in  the  last  month  has  gained  been  16  points  among  men  and  14  points  among  white  voters  .  It's  a  stark  ,  turnaround  .  He  you  now  leads  McCain  among  men  by  five  points  ,  just  a  month  ago  he  trailed  by  11  and  on  when  white  when  voters  .  He's  now  just  four  points  back  .  One  month  ago  .  He  was  18  points  back  .  So  what  happened  .  Well  ,  for  one  ,  the  economy  .  It's  an  understatement  to  say  that  this  past  month  has  been  the  worst  economically  speaking  since  the  campaign  began  and  an  Obama  has  always  had  an  advantage  on  that  issue  ,  but  it's  more  than  just  the  economy  Obama's  game  plan  from  day  one  .  On  the  campaign  trail  has  been  to  campaign  in  all  50  states  ,  not  just  the  states  that  the  Democrats  are  considered  competitive  in  states  like  Virginia  considered  consider  traditionally  Republican  where  Obama  has  opened  10  new  campaign  offices  in  just  the  last  month  alone  ,  of  course  ,  it's  its  financial  advantage  has  allowed  him  to  run  running  a  more  robust  ground  campaign  ,  but  it's  not  just  the  money  ,  it's  about  his  intentions  intention  .  From  day  the  one  .  On  the  campaign  trail  to  reach  out  to  those  white  working  class  moderate  voters  voters  the  Republican  Party  party  has  won  over  in  droves  in  elections  past  passed  .  In  2000  .  For  four  John  Kerry  lost  among  white  men  ,  by  25  points  and  Barack  Obama  .  This  time  around  ,  appears  determined  not  to  make  that  same  mistake  along  that  Gallup  poll  .  The  word  today  is  that  John  McCain  has  conceded  yet  another  state  to  Barack  Obama  Colorado  State  it  that  looks  like  it  is  has  now  completed  the  transformation  from  red  to  blue  Obama  leads  in  the  polls  there  .  And  judging  by  results  in  Michigan  ,  where  Obama  gained  another  boost  in  the  polls  once  McCain  closed  up  shop  and  nasty  .  Well  ,  it  looks  like  Colorado  is  now  safely  in  the  Obama  category  .  But  then  again  ,  with  we  we've  just  two  weeks  left  anything  still  can  can't  happen  today  .  After  all  ,  it  there  was  surprising  news  from  the  campaign  trail  Obama  will  be  leaving  the  trail  for  a  couple  of  days  ,  at  least  to  visit  his  ailing  grandmother  in  Hawaii  .  If  you're  your  across  the  pond  .  You  can  catch  our  very  own  on  Rob  Willis  discussing  that  story  on  Sky  News  this  afternoon  ,  but  suffice  it  to  say  for  a  candidate  Kennedy  who  has  made  double  digit  gains  in  the  polls  over  just  the  last  month  .  There's  there  certainly  no  downside  to  too  little  family  time  away  from  the  campaign  trail  .  But  as  that's  if  your  you're  we're  political  lunch  last  life  launched  Tuesday  snack  thanks  for  watching  C  see  Amara  more

On today&apos;s Political Lunch Tuesday Snack, Will tells you why.";['political_lunch', 'politics', 'barack', 'obama', 'democrats', 'clinton', 'edwards', 'mccain', 'bush']; Welcome  new  political  last  Tuesday  snack  .  Today  we  had  have  a  horse  race  this  morning  .  A  new  poll  from  ABC  News  and  The  Washington  Post  merits  marriage  .  Perhaps  the  boldest  headline  of  the  campaign  thus  far  ,  Hillary  inevitable  .  No  more  .  Now  ,  before  the  Hillary  haters  get  too  excited  the  New  York  senator  does  still  hold  a  significant  lead  nationally  ,  with  20  points  separating  her  from  the  rest  of  the  pack  but  in  you  Iowa  know  as  this  new  poll  found  .  It's  a  very  different  story  .  With  just  44  days  left  and  them  Lee  Iowa  caucus  .  Hillary  Clinton  is  now  trailing  Barack  Obama  ,  at  least  according  to  one  poll  ,  and  although  he  does  have  a  lead  .  That's  this  just  within  the  margin  of  error  .  It  has  to  be  to  break  the  Obama  campaign  was  looking  for  .  Also  noteworthy  is  John  Edwards  ,  who  came  in  a  close  third  with  22  percent  of  vote  votes  ,  and  if  this  poll  is  to  be  believed  ,  we  now  have  a  close  three  way  race  in  the  first  state  to  pick  the  2000  and  8  presidential  nominee  .  What's  more  ,  voters  surveyed  survey  all  said  they  favored  the  concept  of  a  new  direction  and  in  new  ideas  over  strength  and  experience  experienced  the  pundits  .  This  morning  ,  all  agreed  that  this  is  more  good  news  for  the  Obama  campaign  .  But  as  I  said  before  ,  this  is  just  one  poll  pole  ,  and  the  numbers  are  close  enough  to  be  really  a  statistical  tie  in  and  with  Clinton  leading  nationally  tennis  can  really  matter  well  .  The  short  answer  is  yes  in  Iwate  can  .  And  for  that  we  need  to  look  at  our  history  ,  now  back  in  2004  .  The  this  story  in  Iowa  was  supposed  to  be  Howard  Dean  versus  Dick  Gephardt  .  The  two  you  had  have  been  neck  and  neck  for  months  in  Iowa  Ohio  Dean  leading  reading  nationally  but  just  weeks  before  the  caucus  senators  Senators  Edwards  and  Kerry  caught  fire  .  Carey  Kerry  eventually  took  the  win  with  Edwards  a  close  second  Dean  dealing  in  third  and  Gephardt  a  surprisingly  distant  fourth  four  now  .  That  was  the  end  for  Dick  Gephardt  ,  the  beginning  of  the  end  for  Howard  Dean  and  in  for  John  Kerry  was  the  beginning  of  a  nearly  unchallenged  walk  walked  to  the  nomination  .  Back  in  2000  .  A  close  race  in  Iowa  holds  on  the  GOP  ticket  .  John  McCain  ,  campaigning  on  the  street  talk  express  beta  version  was  expected  to  give  George  W  Bush  a  run  for  his  money  well  .  As  things  turned  out  .  McCain  ended  and  up  a  dismal  fifth  behind  Bush  .  Steve  Forbes  ,  Alan  Keyes  and  Gary  Bauer  Bower  .  So  in  Iowa  Ireland  ,  the  tide  tighten  can  shift  and  in  when  it  does  the  nation  sometimes  follows  sometimes  but  not  always  .  Are  all  we  we're  over  back  that  in  107  when  Time  magazine  ran  discover  cover  Michael  Dukakis  and  George  HW  Bush  ,  both  took  third  in  the  Iowa  caucus  yet  went  on  to  take  their  parties'  party's  nominations  .  But  ,  of  course  .  The  real  story  in  the  history  of  the  Iowa  caucus  was  in  111  and  in  Bill  Clinton  .  A  little  known  governor  from  Arkansas  took  just  3  percent  of  the  vote  in  Iowa  .  Yet  went  on  to  win  the  nomination  and  the  White  House  so  the  Obama  campaign  .  Enjoy  it  while  it  lasts  ,  because  it  might  not  last  forever  .  I  will  really  is  isn't  an  and  Bermuda  Triangle  politics  where  promising  polling  data  can  vanish  in  the  a  January  wins  and  we're  just  44  days  from  now  ,  we'll  will  take  the  first  real  step  to  the  2008  presidential  election  .  That's  it  for  political  lunch  thanks  for  watching  Rob  Robin  I  back  tomorrow  .

This  is  a  the  famous  Gillet  Claret  album  where  I  and  enjoyed  all  the  found  time  that  having  adding  the  EU  needs  a  qualifier  .  And  I  just  go  ,  this  CD  .  It's  its  just  US  on  them  here  into  both  starring  in  its  units  it  arms  on  aunts  and  some  great  talent  silent  ,  great  guitar  indefinitely  infinitely  .  I  still  Arsenal  hear  it  and  then  my  answer  through  Munster  is  the  just  plain  plane  odd  .  And  here  sincere  it's  scary  great  Gary  and  Ind  it  is  was  definitely  a  good  song  ,  but  it  will  probably  get  overplayed  to  death  dead  by  Mary  married  yeah  yeah  yes  ,  the  album  is  hard  to  .  But  then  we  go  in  into  ,  you  don't  wake  nearer  near  to  the  nascent  nation  well  armed  power  balance  valid  and  it  if  together  get  and  you  do  did  ,  then  we  go  going  into  a  week  in  a  live  in  it  it's  ,  like  if  it  you  featured  a  the  to  college  color  .

It's  a  great  time  even  feel  glad  caught  that  red  part  partner  that  giving  kidding  killing  getting  .  It's  just  incredible  actually  ordering  wandering  away  way  nobody  nobody's  ,  threatening  yet  ,  and  the  Dow  now  blue  rule  .  If  it's  you  can't  then  them  sometimes  in  is  it's  about  someone  who  doesn't  want  to  be  better  in  tickets  kids  .

Out  of  that  experience  of  being  London  alive  chosen  and  in  beloved  that  the  Allen  Alan  that  we  become  people  that  are  lovers  in  the  world  emerald  .  What  are  they  doing  talking  themselves  with  when  his  bizarre  questions  and  arguments  and  that  nobody  cares  about  and  so  I  kept  thinking  how  can  we  bring  healing  to  theology  NHL  and  guy  by  calling  me  to  too  go  goal  and  studied  study  studying  theology  in  a  way  that  that  started  with  the  experience  of  love  of  being  loved  .  I've  of  been  being  chosen  a  guide  God  died  guy  creating  us  ice  in  and  love  and  and  starting  theology  .  Out  of  this  experience  spiritual  experience  my  why  he  pissed  EPS  him  to  a  more  a  logical  framework  is  not  like  the  typical  systematic  theologians  and  in  its  it's  shape  shaped  .  What  when  I  think  about  my  vocation  today  I  just  wanna  talk  about  this  .  And  tomorrow  ,  we're  going  to  talk  about  how  we  hear  the  answers  to  those  questions  because  for  those  of  us  who  were  gathered  here  many  campus  ministers  ,  some  of  us  in  other  jobs  .  how  we  hear  the  questions  and  how  we  listen  for  the  answers  answer  in  our  own  lives  .  shapes  everything  about  how  we  do  ministry  and  I  want  to  tell  you  something  .  if  we're  not  listening  to  the  questions  then  I  wonder  about  the  value  of  what  we're  doing  .  What  is  the  spirit  saying  to  the  church  .  I  think  the  spirit  is  saying  to  the  church  .  this  word  intention  now  Liddy  anti  Elodie  intention  tension  Alan  allergy  Audi  I  believe  that  the  church  Church  in  the  United  States  and  I  don't  just  mean  United  Methodist  Church  I  mean  the  one  holy  catholic  Apostolic  apostolic  Church  church  I  think  we're  plunging  into  a  dark  night  of  the  soul  I  believe  that  we've  we  become  very  attached  to  things  that  we  think  are  our  God  guide  guy  better  that  bad  side  we've  we  become  really  ,  really  focused  I'm  looking  successful  we  are  we're  really  attached  attach  to  a  fancy  buildings  some  of  us  love  being  called  the  Reverend  Dr.  Doctor  .  we  want  to  be  the  coolest  youth  pastor  around  or  the  snazzy  as  is  Professor  professor  the  one  that  has  a  wait  list  on  her  classes  .  We're  we  very  attached  to  money  in  the  church  .  In  fact  we've  allowed  to  shape  our  whole  system  of  how  we  send  sent  who  we  send  in  and  where  we  send  said  did  I  really  say  that  .  You  know  ,  I  don't  even  have  tenure  .  Yet  why  am  I  saying  these  things  could  get  back  somehow  we  have  what  Ignatius  of  Loyola  column  call  disordered  gets  disorder  affections  .  we  are  attached  to  things  were  where  attached  to  things  John  of  the  cross  talk  talked  about  attachment  attachments  to  he  use  used  uses  his  own  language  .  But  when  what  he  was  talking  about  is  his  attachments  to  that  become  idols  .  today  we  call  them  addictions  .  that  the  drive  us  the  church  churches  is  in  a  dark  night  of  the  soul  .  You  know  the  dark  the  soul  of  is  the  a  spirit  initiated  movement  that  makes  us  have  to  look  in  the  near  and  see  the  attachments  the  idols  and  to  see  what  they've  done  to  us  ,  it's  us  fearing  fear  initiated  movement  that  gives  us  the  opportunity  and  to  be  healed  .  The  thing  about  God  died  .  In  all  of  this  is  the  that  a  guy  doesn't  forces  .  We  can  look  in  the  new  New  year  Year  .  We  can  see  the  attachments  and  we  can  be  like  they  that  die  guy  in  the  matrix  that  you  know  the  one  what's  but  Watson  the  name  and  a  M&A  I  guy  the  The  matrix  Matrix  is  the  The  Judas  figure  you  know  ,  I'm  talking  about  cipher  safer  site  he'd  rather  eat  fake  fakes  state  .  You  know  the  visual  state  ,  then  you  know  ,  I'm  talking  about  RN  and  than  I  can  explain  this  go  watch  the  movie  we  can  think  it  they  comes  can  her  we  can  look  in  the  mere  Mir  see  reality  and  say  no  thanks  I  prefer  my  illusions  allusions  and  God  will  let  us  that  God  will  let  us  but  so  we  have  a  chance  now  we're  at  a  critical  time  in  the  history  of  the  church  right  now  .  To  move  through  the  night  to  a  new  day  to  come  home  to  our  real  vocation  relocation  our  true  selves  as  the  church  as  individuals  .  and  become  God's  gods  good  news  in  the  world  .  We  have  a  the  chance  to  do  .  That  was  is  the  spirit  ,  saying  saint  to  the  church  .  The  spirit  of  is  saying  intention  Elodie  and  what  is  does  God's  God  saying  too  me  mean  when  what  it's  is  Jesus  saying  to  me  anyway  Elaine  .  Alice  now  he  heat  attention  now  Woody  Liddy  I've  been  studying  for  several  years  now  this  phenomenon  that  we  call  the  emerging  church  I've  been  reading  a  lot  about  Newman  asked  Astor  to  sizzle  hey  I  saw  was  gonna  to  be  speaking  later  if  you  he  think  they  an  I'm  can  exciting  excited  I've  been  reading  these  things  I've  been  speaking  thinking  about  the  woman  who  mentored  me  in  and  my  spiritual  formation  for  20  years  until  she  died  last  year  .  They've  been  they're  faking  about  how  Betty  used  to  say  to  me  ,  you  know  ,  we  remain  rain  reign  couple  of  things  you  need  to  know  .  As  is  you  move  forward  into  more  and  more  public  ministry  .  Don't  ever  seek  the  limelight  ,  she  said  .  Don't  ever  seek  the  limelight  .

The  downfall  bet  Benny  Betty  spent  her  life  forming  small  communities  of  mission  Mission  all  or  Christians  four  willing  to  die  for  Jesus  she  she  mentored  me  that  somehow  after  about  10  years  of  being  mentored  by  her  ended  at  up  the  United  Methodist  Church  here  I  am  AM  ,  for  crying  out  loud  when  his  dad  guards  saying  to  me  well  ,  after  reading  all  these  books  and  doing  all  these  things  sometime  in  the  spring  .  Early  February  .  I  I  sensed  guard  guide  saying  to  me  ,  rain  .  It's  time  for  you  to  become  part  of  the  solution  to  the  problem  .

He  I  just  left  let  the  United  Methodist  Church  psyche  site  answer  my  call  and  it  breaks  my  heart  .  because  nothing  nepotism  started  out  as  a  community  of  intention  Elodie  did  it  not  and  so  I  felt  the  Holy  Spirit  saying  to  me  you  need  to  be  part  of  the  solution  .  Now's  announced  announce  the  that  time  don't  go  get  some  students  so  get  forget  it  and  former  for  community  figure  figured  it  out  .  Work  workout  out  the  violence  and  then  cooperate  as  the  Holy  Spirit  opens  the  doors  cooperate  in  the  denomination  and  invite  people  to  join  and  let's  see  what  we  can  do  about  this  problem  .  Because  here's  the  problem  .  I  have  more  and  more  students  and  they  tend  to  be  my  very  best  students  ,  they  tend  to  be  the  most  creative  .  The  most  innovative  .  The  most  the  be  a  logically  reflective  .  The  most  compassionate  the  least  controlled  by  a  desire  for  money  and  privilege  .  And  what  they're  are  saying  is  I  want  to  serve  Jesus  in  a  way  that  is  transformational  .

We  have  more  students  .  You  know  last  year  and  the  year  before  ,  we  had  have  students  dying  from  drug  overdoses  and  things  like  that  .  They  have  to  ask  myself  how  can  we  at  help  Perkins  partner  with  Andy  Roberts  that  the  campus  minister  for  the  Wesley  Foundation  foundation  .  How  can  we  had  have  Perkins  Africans  partner  with  the  Chapmans  chaplains  office  .  What  why  can  can't  we  do  know  to  be  more  mission  all  there  and  so  we've  we  started  this  community  and  in  you  can  read  about  it  online  .  It's  its  W  W  W  dot  new  New  day  date  Day  Dallas  balance  dot  org  we've  been  going  now  for  a  few  months  our  star  worship  gathering  is  on  Sunday  nights  and  the  youngest  persons  person  .

We  have  PhDs  we  have  affluent  white  people  we  have  African  Americans  .  It's  a  very  small  community  .  We  have  had  a  a  child  or  there  two  too  and  we  formed  form  this  community  and  in  starting  in  January  .  We're  gonna  be  a  family  for  four  ESA  S  new  students  .  We're  were  gonna  come  common  and  we're  gonna  eat  potluck  supper  with  us  ,  and  if  we  we're  were  going  gonna  to  bring  the  food  every  Sunday  night  not  ,  when  really  it  was  the  students  that  come  coming  in  and  we're  going  to  love  them  and  be  their  family  that's  our  first  mission  .  But  you  know  what  I  have  five  groups  of  people  in  five  different  cities  now  in  Texas  in  and  beyond  the  natural  plaques  plants  that  are  ready  to  start  a  new  day  community  has  they  heard  about  it  .  So  Simon  I'm  in  conversation  .  Now  ,  with  North  Texas  conference  Conference  in  Central  Texas  Conference  conference  in  and  some  other  people  how  can  could  we  knew  this  when  what  he  goes  says  knows  is  a  is  a  new  monastic  community  it's  that's  anchored  in  an  existing  church  all  of  us  who  leaders  lead  an  in  and  equal  team  of  pastors  are  Bible  bible  case  .  No  ,  we  don't  we'll  get  paid  .  We  don't  wanna  get  paid  .  We've  sworn  off  being  paid  to  be  the  pastors  of  this  community  the  were  more  anchored  apron  in  and  an  existing  established  church  for  purposes  of  friendship  and  mutual  enrichment  but  we  worship  together  in  our  community  and  we  serve  we're  were  getting  ready  to  spread  out  new  you  day  what  is  Jesus  saying  to  Elaine  Jesus's  Jesus  saying  when  it's  not  enough  to  read  about  it  ,  write  right  about  you  have  to  do  it  .  you  won't  be  happy  until  you  do  .  What  is  God  died  saying  to  the  world  what  is  God's  scarred  seeing  to  this  world  there's  it's  this  a  lot  of  scary  stuff  going  on  in  the  world  right  now  .  I  believe  God  that  is  saying  you  don't  have  to  be  doing  doomed  my  church  might  not  be  getting  it  at  ,  but  I'd  ,  I'd  get  it  I  I'd  love  you  .  And  I'm  gonna  find  a  way  away  I  I'm  hear  here  dogs  I'm  God's  saying  to  the  world  .  I  have  a  led  an  alternative  vision  for  how  to  be  together  as  is  people  and  how  people  can  relate  to  animals  in  the  land  .  the  air  and  the  water  I  hear  hereby  died  saying  these  things  in  and  its  it's  this  haunting  me  .  and  I'm  not  gonna  be  happy  unless  they  I  participate  with  the  hide  behind  it  what  God  is  saying  and  doing  in  the  world  .  I  can't  stand  being  locked  up  in  a  religious  fortress  .  Not  now  one  more  nanosecond  .  Can  anybody  say  man  then  I  just  can't  I  just  can't  you  know  what  why  I  I'm  am  54  years  old  I'm  54  years  old  and  women  a  they  die  in  and  a  few  blinks  of  the  eye  I  don't  have  any  time  to  waste  .  My  life  has  to  go  where  God  wants  it  to  go  .  If  it  doesn't  go  there  .  What's  the  point  .  Three  questions  that  keep  hauntingly  they  the  wake  me  up  in  the  morning  .  They  put  me  to  sleep  at  night  every  book  I  read  .  They're  their  there  coming  out  of  the  pages  every  movie  I  watched  watch  they're  there  their  saying  things  to  me  in  the  story  line  ,  and  I'm  looking  into  your  eyes  ,  and  I  see  the  questions  .  Looking  back  what  is  the  this  spirit  ,  saying  to  the  church  .  Well  what  ,  it's  is  Jesus  saying  to  me  my  why  Scott  start  saying  to  the  world  ask  asking  Elaine  lane  if  she  would  take  a  question  or  two  we  have  ,  but  we  have  a  few  minutes  .  So  what  it  does  is  it  won't  would  whenever  have  a  questionnaire  questioner  response  that  you  you'd  liked  like  send  your  Elaine  lanes  way  yes  ,  there  is  and  a  we're  more  working  in  partnership  with  them  .  We  are  our  are  worship  gathering  meets  in  the  Wesley  house  we're  working  in  partnership  with  them  and  with  it  the  chaplains  office  John  Josh  .  We  we  designed  design  a  to  rule  of  life  .  One  of  my  might  mine  okay  .  The  question  was  to  tell  him  about  our  rule  our  communities  community  rule  Israel  of  light  ,  Michael  Pastor  pastor  need  her  Hearn  ,  and  is  as  a  doctor  of  ministry  student  for  his  doctor  of  ministry  project  he  worked  with  myself  and  in  our  intern  internal  Richard  Newton  and  we  designed  design  together  a  rule  of  life  that  puts  meat  on  the  bones  of  the  United  Methodist  membership  bows  prayers  presence  give  gives  service  and  witness  all  he's  it's  has  got  a  lot  of  stuff  attached  like  fasting  weekly  ,  for  example  ,  and  things  like  that  .  And  so  our  rule  of  life  is  on  our  website  ,  you  can  look  at  it  and  ,  ,  we  have  a  an  old  fashioned  Wesley  ban  band  meeting  press  for  pastors  .  We  meet  regularly  and  share  Cher  and  pray  and  it's  just  a  marvelous  thing  I  forgot  to  tell  you  we  start  started  monastic  houses  too  .  We  have  our  first  house  .  It's  called  the  upper  house  .  Every  new  day  community  will  have  an  upper  house  attached  to  it  .  The  Epworth  project  is  sound  .  Students  can  live  there  rent  free  .  Other  than  their  utilities  they  follow  the  rule  of  life  ,  living  in  a  the  house  they  serve  served  the  neighborhood  in  which  the  house  is  was  located  by  ministries  of  hospitality  .  and  they  participate  in  the  new  day  worshipping  community  and  that's  that  way  a  Madden  students  coming  into  Perkins  able  will  to  live  a  limit  monastic  houses  house  for  two  or  three  years  .  attending  this  the  kind  worship  formation  additional  community  and  then  being  deployed  into  the  church  .  you  he  think  it'll  change  things  yeah  he  it  may  not  I  have  a  the  question  sure  how  do  you  read  the  Bible  with  the  students  in  these  communities  like  but  with  the  S  US  in  and  US  West  than  End  ,  for  example  ,  have  how  you  do  or  were  how  are  they  hardly  .  Reading  the  Bible  together  ,  our  internal  intern  Richard  his  primary  job  Johnson's  since  we  just  started  our  community  our  are  internal  intern  Richard  primary  job  this  year  is  to  work  with  any  other  the  Wesley  and  figure  out  how  to  connect  our  new  day  community  with  what's  happening  with  the  West  Wesley  ,  sleep  on  camp  that  is  so  that  we  support  everything  they're  doing  and  help  them  and  so  Richard  has  a  I  blonde  blog  he  has  Bible  studies  .  He  does  the  with  was  students  he  does  some  other  things  in  and  our  are  intern  for  next  year  is  already  working  with  Andy  to  figure  out  how  she  can  work  and  doing  spiritual  formation  with  leaders  in  the  Wesley  Foundation  foundation  and  in  some  things  like  that  .  So  that's  how  we  connect  doing  spiritual  formation  it  it's  cyclical  in  and  history  .  You  can  see  it  happening  .  there's  a  wonderful  book  called  emergence  margins  by  Phyllis  Tickle  ,  the  great  emerges  emergence  mergers  .  I  recommend  that  you  are  all  reading  read  she  quotes  Archbishop  archbishop  somebody  or  your  other  others  whose  name  namely  you  with  me  at  the  moment  ,  who  says  that  every  500  years  .  The  church  has  a  great  big  rummage  sale  and  realize  realizes  it's  gonna  gotta  guy  get  rid  of  a  lot  of  things  that  aren't  working  and  so  a  new  movement  emerges  and  then  the  old  MoMA  movement  doesn't  go  away  ,  but  it's  its  cleansed  claims  and  heal  the  revitalized  and  in  so  then  you  have  to  two  know  new  acts  and  there's  there  this  great  outbreak  of  the  evangelism  and  mission  and  we're  work  right  now  .  One  of  those  500  year  rummage  sales  were  where  the  Church  church  has  gone  to  sleep  asleep  .  Now  it's  got  gotta  a  wake  up  and  we'll  see  what  happens  .  How  do  I  do  find  define  the  a  church  the  people  of  have  God  gone  people  are  of  a  gone  guy  .  The  body  of  Christ  .  In  the  world  .  Over  here  ,  I  think  there  it  was  an  yes  thank  you  ,  she  said  .  What  advice  I  give  to  those  of  you  who  are  becoming  pastors  pastor  .  Those  of  you  were  young  younger  ministries  to  help  imagine  imagined  towards  a  the  future  like  this  in  and  the  church  ,  and  that's  what  the  book  is  about  the  mystic  mystique  Mystic  wavy  weighty  vandalism  .  First  of  all  ,  it's  its  understanding  where  we  are  in  this  period  should  of  shifting  but  the  this  postmodern  modern  shifts  chefs  ships  and  then  I'm  saying  that  we  need  to  look  to  the  their  real  exemplar  the  vandalism  evangelism  ,  which  I  believe  in  are  the  great  Christian  mystic  mistakes  some  states  .  We  have  been  so  shaped  by  consumerism  by  hyperactivity  and  by  buy  the  their  concerns  of  our  our  culture  right  now  .  Around  us  that  we've  forgotten  to  look  to  the  Saints  saints  .  And  so  ,  in  my  book  .  In  the  middle  section  of  the  book  .  They  I  have  10  different  saints  states  and  how  they  speak  to  our  condition  today  and  how  they  show  us  where  we  need  to  go  and  how  they  help  us  to  detach  from  our  idols  and  how  they  help  us  to  reach  out  for  Christ  and  to  be  authentic  to  be  our  true  selves  in  the  last  part  of  the  book  ,  which  ,  my  friend  Lane  Elaine  lane  Rees  Reese  tells  me  it's  a  lot  easier  to  read  .  In  than  the  first  part  of  the  book  I  cast  a  vision  for  what  where  a  church  would  look  like  .  I  call  it  first  church  Church  .  What  would  it  look  like  if  it  it  that  lived  in  a  contemplative  stance  .  And  so  I  had  have  a  the  story  line  that  goes  for  a  few  chapters  and  in  it's  its  that  the  the  last  few  chapters  are  fast  read  I'm  and  hopefully  substantive  substantively  fast  ,  saying  this  is  what  it  could  look  like  with  with  teams  of  pastors  and  function  as  equals  and  not  a  hierarchy  smaller  mission  or  all  congregations  and  that  let's  spread  out  and  ad  networks  instead  of  having  been  conglomerates  and  why  .  ,  this  is  gonna  be  much  more  helpful  in  reaching  the  abandoned  places  of  that  empire  WTF  we're  were  seeing  poverty  escalate  and  an  alarming  rate  even  out  on  the  suburbs  is  there's  has  a  lot  more  poverty  than  there  used  to  be  ,  and  we  have  to  rethink  mission  ,  how  can  we  do  this  ,  and  in  an  age  of  poverty  and  violence  .  Many  crises  .  so  that  book  booking  and  in  the  book  that's  coming  out  up  that  it's  Scott  gotten  and  I  wrote  longing  for  spring  Spring  is  how  to  they  develop  and  in  lead  leave  New  new  monastic  communities  as  United  Methodists  and  that  should  hopefully  be  a  helpful  tool  as  well  .  .  Well  ,  what  we're  doing  our  our  original  group  new  New  day  Day  as  the  new  sinew  is  anchored  at  Lovers  Lane  United  Methodist  Church  so  we  have  a  formal  relationship  with  lovers'  Lovers  lover's  lovers  Lane  lane  as  is  has  a  satellite  congregation  and  .  What  that  means  in  practical  terms  ,  is  that  we  send  our  money  to  them  then  .  They  have  a  budget  just  for  us  .  We  send  our  money  to  them  and  then  they  write  the  checks  to  where  we  want  them  to  go  and  we  are  available  to  help  develop  more  new  day  communities  that  reach  out  to  special  areas  of  mission  and  we're  gonna  be  doing  that  in  the  next  couple  years  with  them  .  It  also  means  that  ,  let's  lets  say  that  what  while  we're  gonna  going  start  a  new  day  community  in  Arlington  ,  which  is  in  another  conference  ,  and  we're  were  working  on  details  of  with  that  now  ,  but  the  pastor  my  might  Michael  Pastor  pastor  any  knee  only  heard  was  is  there's  gonna  going  be  leading  reading  that  with  was  some  other  people  make  Nate  really  wants  to  work  with  at  risk  youth  youths  he  keep  heat  his  day  job  as  is  any  he  works  for  the  school  district  as  a  vice  principal  and  as  is  a  truancy  specialist  specialists  to  who  his  whole  life  .  He's  worked  with  kids  who  are  at  risk  .  Kids  that  are  in  trouble  with  the  law  .  Poor  people  ,  and  that's  where  his  is  heart  hearty  as  he's  so  we're  gonna  going  start  a  community  there'll  be  anchored  in  an  existing  United  Methodist  Church  when  they  start  doing  ,  creating  the  school  .  They're  gonna  create  starting  with  early  childhood  education  .  People  from  the  host  church  Church  can  help  with  some  of  those  projects  can  can't  stop  spell  the  to  feed  into  it  .  ,  but  they're  not  gonna  dominated  dominate  and  be  in  charge  of  it  ,  and  it's  has  not  gonna  been  become  a  big  bureaucracy  .  This  is  an  anti  bureaucratic  movement  so  it's  it's  a  mutually  beneficial  relationship  in  the  a  history  of  in  Manassas  ,  as  I'm  isn't  healthy  helping  Manassas  ,  as  says  am  always  involves  a  community  that's  that  anchored  in  the  rest  of  the  church  that  helps  to  bring  healing  and  in  life  to  the  church  and  helps  help  to  stay  sustain  right  side  up  because  of  the  church  .  The  a  set  Senate  of  turning  into  a  weird  culture  Coulter  ,  something  okay  anyone  else  thank  you  ,  God  bless  you  ,  I  will  talk  to  you  tomorrow  .  answering  the  questions  RN  right

Zionism  was  with  a  the  nation  state  ideology  which  aimed  at  the  foundation  of  an  independent  Jewish  state  .  The  reason  for  this  depended  on  the  colonialist  and  social  don't  Darwin  win  this  series  ,  which  dominated  19th  century  Europe  according  to  these  theories  the  industrialized  nations  of  the  West  had  the  right  to  colonize  less  developed  nations  .  this  was  envisioned  as  a  natural  result  of  the  concept  of  the  struggle  for  survival  between  nations  predicted  by  John  winners  wins  is  the  Jews  who  put  forward  the  idea  of  Zionism  approved  of  at  this  19th  century  European  air  and  constructed  their  own  ideologies  and  in  the  like  light  line  .  that  is  why  racism  races  became  a  part  partner  of  Zionist  ideology  .

There  is  ,  in  addition  to  being  fairly  kicking  kick  kicker  it's  a  great  superhero  movie  action  is  not  now  really  superior  to  great  Marvel  Comics  adaptation  ,  but  found  bro  Breaux  knows  Bruno's  that  a  guy  running  around  in  and  a  robot  suit  kicking  ass  is  pretty  silly  .  And  he's  not  afraid  to  put  that  out  there  and  Robert  Downey  Jr  Junior  is  has  as  that  a  had  great  comic  timing  .  In  this  movie  .  Moroccan  Russian  soccer  robots  in  in  and  3D  and  technical  there's  is  a  lot  more  going  on  here  because  he's  playing  this  wealthy  industrialist  Tony  Stark  who  stark  Stark  industries  Industries  and  they  basically  profit  their  there  war  profiteers  .  They  make  money  off  of  selling  arms  and  when  his  partner  sells  arms  to  the  wrong  people  .

I  think  this  move  is  gonna  blow  out  up  .  But  Robert  Downey  Jr  is  really  ,  really  funny  .  He's  is  a  great  leading  man  .  You  know  ,  Terrence  Howard  ,  not  a  lot  to  do  when  a  Paltrow  did  great  in  and  a  small  role  .  I  think  they  had  have  some  sparks  flying  violence  and  stuff  .  This  was  a  big  crowd  pleaser  ,  too  to  two  ,  and  I  think  it's  it's  a  mature  enough  movie  as  a  fantasy  movie  that  works  on  every  level  ,  that  it's  trying  to  yeah  .  I  mean  ,  I  think  we've  had  a  lot  of  things  that  don't  quite  work  in  inspiration  fishing  searching  for  comic  book  adaptations  and  a  lot  of  times  you  he  see  seen  seemed  movies  where  directors  have  really  tried  to  put  in  those  like  special  beats  beat  the  comic  book  crowd  proud  yeah  and  they  he  oftentimes  often  goat  just  can't  come  arrive  right  ahead  head  overhead  because  they're  there  just  time  badly  ,  but  several  Faber  really  understands  calmly  comedy  and  I  think  you  he  really  understood  understand  .  I'm  in  the  comics  comments  ,  and  I  think  is  a  great  job  .  Is  there  some  huge  applause  and  a  little  middle  mini  anyone  when  college  comics  players  fans  it  fans  things  happens  pans  out  because  they  were  hidden  hit  all  the  right  points  in  and  and  really  making  those  things  happened  they  say  said  the  best  Web  pages  one  .  He  you  never  had  have  a  fire  .  I  I've  further  prefer  preferred  referred  the  weapons  weapon  .  You  only  need  to  a  far  fly  and  it's  worked  out  pretty  well  so  far  .  The  case  there's  this  a  huge  rock  rocks  fest  dust  this  way  the  up  out  for  from  me  for  Iron  Man  language  under  skin  skated  and  give  us  this  a  solid  rock  fessed  fest  up  ,  which  is  no  you  know  bad  thing  .  I  think  it  was  a  really  great  superhero  movie  didn't  have  that  ,  like  definitive  ,  kind  of  ,  you  know  Spider  Spiderman  Man  two  II  moment  where  he's  he  on  top  of  the  subway  crowd  crowding  .  And  has  this  big  been  character  realization  .  But  it's  very  entertaining  ,  it's  is  really  well  done  ,  and  I  think  it's  really  smart  ,  too  .  and  I  think  that's  the  key  .  So  a  duffel  in  with  foreign  four  and  another  I'm  in  three  as  hours  well  long  on  as  far  as  and  I  am  .  Or  am  I  will  be  looking  for  the  same  party

Millions more are struggling to pay premiums that are growing five times faster than wages, but still seeing their benefits shrink. While some Americans have access to the most sophisticated medical care in the world, others are left to overcrowded emergency rooms, under-funded clinics, or no health care at all - all because they lack the insurance it takes to provide for the care they need. This is wrong. It violates America&#39;s deep, long-standing commitment to fairness for all of our citizens - old and young, weak and strong. Unlocking our health care system&#39;s potential for everyone in America is the great moral challenge of our time. Center for American Progress Health Policy Director Karen Davenport explains what&#39;s at stake as President Bush prepares to deliver his final State of the Union address in ASK THE EXPERT, CAP&#39;s new video feature. <br /><br />www.AMERICANPROGRESS.org</span>";['health', 'disease', 'hospital', 'progressive', 'insurance']; Why  we  should  shared  .  Here  is  something  about  how  we  can  provide  health  insurance  coverage  .  The  47  million  Americans  who  are  currently  uninsured  well  ,  we'll  probably  hear  from  President  Bush  is  a  warmed  over  version  of  his  proposal  from  last  year  ,  which  would  had  move  moved  people  frowned  frown  .  The  employer  market  and  group  coverage  into  the  individual  insurance  market  ,  which  is  really  dysfunctional  way  of  providing  health  insurance  coverage  for  the  few  people  who  were  are  there  today  .  Player  implant  market  for  health  insurance  is  really  useful  because  it  allows  healthy  people  and  sick  people  to  be  part  of  the  same  risk  pool  and  this  means  that  costs  are  averaged  across  everybody  who's  in  the  pool  big  bit  ,  given  that  20  percent  of  the  population  interest  80  percent  %  in  and  health  healthcare  care  costs  .  It's  really  important  to  have  young  healthy  people  and  an  older  sick  sicker  people  or  ,  for  that  matter  ,  younger  sick  people  ,  all  in  the  same  pool  pools  poor  so  that  no  rate  for  everybody  evens  out  and  in  that  variation  doesn't  hit  any  in  any  individual  too  hard  in  the  individual  market  insures  ensures  just  look  at  your  own  experience  with  health  care  and  in  with  the  kind  of  health  conditions  that  you  have  .  So  if  you  were  to  develop  Davies  or  to  have  a  high  risk  pregnancy  or  to  have  breast  cancer  your  you're  rates  would  skyrocket  out  up  and  ,  in  fact  that  ,  you  might  not  be  able  to  purchase  health  insurance  at  all  .  If  you're  part  of  a  larger  group  like  you  are  in  the  employer  market  .  That  won't  would  happen  .  the  American  public's  been  really  clear  that  they  want  our  health  care  system  to  change  that  .  They  want  to  be  able  to  provide  health  insurance  coverage  .  The  47  million  Americans  who  don't  have  it  ,  but  we're  not  gonna  be  able  to  do  that  in  2000  and  8  because  President  Bush  and  his  veto  Penner  are  looming  out  there  and  in  what  all  but  we  can  do  this  year  is  to  set  out  up  for  a  change  in  2000  and  9  .  We  can  improve  health  care  quality  right  now  and  improve  the  efficiency  of  our  health  care  system  ,  for  example  by  making  new  investments  in  and  preventive  care  by  making  sure  that  people  can  who  get  their  immunizations  and  in  the  check  checkups  ups  that  they  need  ,  they  pay  they  their  kids  get  well  child  care  to  make  sure  that  they  do  well  in  school  and  by  making  investments  in  technology  that  make  for  a  more  efficient  and  also  a  safer  see  health  healthcare  care  system  .  If  we  do  theirs  will  be  able  to  really  take  on  the  issue  of  the  uninsured  in  2000  and  9  .

The things we think we know&#8212;but don&#39;t... America is at a crossroads. In the face of global competition and rapid technological change, our economy is about to face its most severe test in nearly a century&#8212;one that will make the recent turmoil in the financial system look like a modest setback by comparison. Yet our leaders have failed to prepare us for what lies ahead because they are in the grip of a set of ""dead ideas"" about how a modern economy should work. They wrongly believe that * Our kids will earn more than we do * Free trade is always good, no matter who gets hurt * Employers should be responsible for health coverage * Taxes hurt the economy * Schools are a local matter * Money follows merit These ways of thinking&#8212;dubious at best and often dead wrong&#8212;are on a collision course with economic developments that are irreversible. In The Tyranny of Dead Ideas, Matt Miller offers a unique blend of insights from history, psychology, and economics to illuminate where today&#39;s destructive conventional wisdom came from and how it holds our country back. He also introduces us to a new way of thinking&#8212;what he calls ""tomorrow&#39;s destined ideas""&#8212;that can reinvigorate our economy, our politics, and our day-to-day lives. These destined ideas may seem counterintuitive now, but they will coalesce in the coming years in ways that will transform America. A strikingly original assessment of our current dilemma and an indispensable guide to our future, Miller&#39;s provocative and path-breaking book reveals why it is urgent that we break the tyranny of dead ideas, for it is only by doing so that we can move beyond the limits of today&#39;s obsolete debates and reinvent American capitalism and democracy for the twenty-first century.</p>";['matt', 'miller', 'dead', 'economy', 'american', 'progressive']; But  you  know  ,  I  clearly  have  a  very  progressive  desire  to  promote  opportunity  and  security  and  ,  ,  you  know  ,  in  in  of  rapidly  changing  economy  .

In  other  words  ,  the  that  people  end  and  up  economically  where  were  they  deserved  deserve  .

At  of  the  very  tip  it  up  this  is  point  pulling  away  from  the  rest  ,  not  through  ,  you  know  the  the  rewards  of  the  free  market  and  nobody  nobody  answered  me  .  I  don't  begrudge  Bill  Gates  or  Steve  Jobs  their  wealth  with  the  a  fantastic  innovations  on  and  the  and  contributions  they  make  to  society  .

I  think  we're  in  a  moment  where  this  may  be  part  of  what  for  .

I  think  we've  overestimated  the  power  of  the  individual  to  shape  his  own  economic  destiny  .  At  this  moment  in  the  history  of  Jack  yet  American  capitalism  .  That's  not  too  grand  and  that  that  the  we  need  a  rebalancing  balancing  then  than  between  the  role  of  government  ,  and  the  role  of  ,  you  know  your  ,  private  citizens  with  of  the  individual  and  making  sure  that  we  have  a  decent  society  with  the  kind  of  opportunity  and  security  .  We  would  expect  from  a  wealthy  country  it  that  of  was  the  trying  strategy  to  do  right  ,  but  I  think  we  will  never  get  where  we  need  to  go  to  compete  in  a  global  economy  unless  we  have  a  nationally  defined  set  of  what  kids  you  know  whether  they're  there  in  Birmingham  ,  a  where  Boston  on  order  now  and  that's  not  different  from  saying  that  you  know  wonderful  crusading  leaders  at  the  local  level  and  I've  had  my  professional  life  and  the  the  the  privilege  of  working  with  some  of  these  folks  in  different  in  different  districts  .

It's  a  concern  for  consumers  who  want  to  make  sure  that  we  have  innovations  on  and  privacy  has  we  three  of  have  the  other  innovations  in  and  search  engines  ,  so  one  question  is  how  much  mergers  of  Internet  internet  companies  will  affect  privacy  all  or  well  one  thing  you  notice  is  that  if  there's  there  a  database  of  in  one  company  in  and  database  in  and  another  company  .  The  merger  emerge  might  like  put  those  together  .  Then  there  is  there's  things  about  different  parts  .  Your  here  life  are  being  put  together  now  to  some  extent  this  already  happens  inside  one  company  .  If  you  go  to  Google  Maps  and  they're  able  to  link  that  to  your  year  Google  Search  Google  Maps  might  tell  them  tresses  for  ,  which  are  home  addresses  .  Could  can  you  she  keep  putting  in  the  directions  and  that's  one  of  the  things  that  we  see  already  inside  one  company  .  But  when  you  merge  the  big  databases  .  You've  got  issues  of  what's  getting  merged  merge  .  on  ,  that  might  turn  out  to  be  good  ,  maybe  the  companies  that  merge  will  turn  out  to  improve  their  practices  .  It  might  turn  out  that  people  didn't  suspect  all  on  this  data  is  was  as  an  gonna  put  input  into  one  place  ,  then  the  question  is  will  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  ,  while  will  the  be  European  regulators  will  somebody  stepped  step  in  and  make  sure  ensure  the  privacy  protections  are  in  place  .  the  a  privacy  solution  solutions  should  merging  companies  consider  in  and  a  lot  of  ways  .  The  answer  is  the  to  privacy  solutions  .  They  should  said  have  had  .  Before  the  merger  .  This  they  it  should  she  give  did  you  notice  of  what  they're  doing  with  what  you  your  data  .  They  this  should  be  .  The  choice  before  it  goes  to  some  other  place  and  a  the  big  issue  that's  emerging  now  as  is  they  issued  should  .  I  think  give  giving  getting  choice  before  doing  behavioral  profiling  .  That  means  before  they  decide  what  to  do  with  you  as  you  go  around  the  web  Web  site  website  and  around  the  Web  web  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  has  hearings  going  on  right  now  saying  that  maybe  we  really  should  have  some  choices  about  when  we're  tracking  when  one  we're  were  not  track  behavior  .  Really  .  And  if  that  those  protections  to  could  put  in  place  .  This  may  maybe  be  in  the  long  run  ,  we  have  some  federal  privacy  legislation  .  It's  it  as  basic  standards  ,  and  I  think  that  works  both  spoke  before  the  mergers  is  merger's  in  after  the  murders  mergers  .

We  need  their  that  community  now  far  more  than  ever  .  You  see  people  finding  that  their  community  .  When  you  get  in  a  room  with  skilled  actors  beautiful  design  incredible  performances  is  at  that  those  moments  that  our  hearts  truly  cracked  crack  wide  open  and  were  we're  able  to  really  human  another  and  celebrate  what  can  connects  access  .  There's  a  few  moments  from  the  past  year  that  I  wanted  to  share  with  you  where  we've  seen  that  happen  this  summer  .

(3:46);[]; ,  the  gentleman  yield  .  Are  you  a  yield  of  6  hours  thousand  times  and  we  and  can't  see  my  thank  the  gentleman  for  yielding  .  I  would  say  ,  of  course  ,  we  come  to  the  floor  .  Today  ,  with  lots  Watson  of  disappointment  on  what  were  failing  to  do  today  .  We  think  we  should  stay  until  we  get  other  matters  done  .  But  on  this  issue  that  relates  to  the  activities  of  the  day  .  A  first  of  all  ball  ,  I  was  at  the  memorial  services  service  .  Many  of  you  or  I  was  privileged  to  be  there  .  And  frankly  ,  there  are  very  few  members  of  Congress  and  the  history  ,  the  Congress  congress  that  could  have  on  the  very  short  notice  that  we  would  have  this  said  service  today  would  have  the  foreign  minister  of  Israel  ,  the  secretary  of  state  ,  the  head  of  the  United  Nations  the  speaker  of  the  house  House  .  It  was  an  impressive  service  and  ,  ,  I  hated  hate  that  ,  ,  we  have  in  this  debate  around  any  lack  of  respect  for  that  service  .  On  the  other  hand  ,  the  only  work  we  had  to  do  today  was  one  hour  of  debate  on  a  rule  that  would  then  ban  also  replace  replaced  the  debate  one  hour  of  debate  .  The  service  was  scheduled  to  last  from  10  o'clock  until  11  ,  30  .  It  turned  out  ,  it  that  lasted  last  till  until  11  ,  50  .  But  it  was  schedule  last  from  ten  o'clock  till  11  ,  30  whenever  it  went  when  win  at  10  ,  45  .  The  majority  decides  we're  gonna  going  start  .  The  one  hour  of  work  we  have  to  do  today  and  at  11  the  majority  should  expect  the  other  side  to  complain  yep  and  backed  Mr  .  Diaz  D  Gallardo  had  not  had  his  objection  fifteen  fifty  minutes  of  that  about  one  hour  debate  would've  would  been  gone  before  I  ever  walked  out  of  the  memorial  service  the  boat  vote  lasted  50  minutes  are  our  thereabouts  apparently  members  couldn't  even  get  in  the  boat  for  15  minutes  ,  let  alone  get  him  in  to  participate  in  the  debate  .  Of  course  ,  we  should  have  said  last  not  start  starred  the  debate  on  the  only  work  we're  doing  today  .  While  why  we're  were  passing  up  the  work  on  the  Foreign  Intelligence  Surveillance  Act  were  voting  to  talk  about  how  you  can  kill  rats  in  a  the  technical  correction  to  the  federal  Federal  insecticide  ponderous  side  aside  and  wrote  rolled  road  Dent  dent  aside  side  act  out  Act  that's  the  only  debate  we're  having  happy  today  we  were  gonna  have  during  the  15  minutes  of  it  .  Of  the  one  hour  during  the  a  memorial  service  Lincoln  Diaz  Gallardo  or  somebody  should  have  stepped  up  to  stop  there  .  Thank  goodness  he  did  and  I  am  I'm  I  really  sad  that  a  the  service  .  We  should  have  all  agreed  on  would  be  the  priority  of  the  morning  .  We  couldn't  manage  for  that  to  be  the  priority  the  morning  we  had  to  start  the  one  hour  of  work  we  had  to  do  15  minutes  before  that  service  was  scheduled  with  what  the  it  turned  out  to  end  and  30  minutes  before  it  was  the  scheduled  to  end  .  I  I'm  am  regretful  that  my  good  friend  had  to  rise  to  this  moment  of  personal  privilege  ,  but  I  certainly  support  him  in  and  seeking  this  privilege  and  hope  that  the  members  the  House  will  understand  what  happened  here  and  appreciate  the  great  respect  .  We  all  have  to  Tom  Lantos  .  I  feel  you  bad  bat  .  Thank  you  .

We  had  to  do  a  little  research  on  the  service  .  It  turns  out  that  Twitter  lets  users  post  updates  and  links  in  real  time  is  long  as  is  his  messages  come  coming  in  under  a  hundred  and  forty  characters  .  Then  than  ,  as  is  usual  ,  we  quickly  forgot  about  our  regional  assignment  sign  when  we  noticed  a  surprising  amount  of  professional  and  retired  athletes  are  using  the  service  .  Everyone  from  Terrell  Owens  and  Chad  Johnson  that  the  Annika  Sorenstam  and  Danica  Patrick  ,  are  on  their  there  delivering  riveting  updates  like  you  know  your  you're  boys  boy  so  Hood  HUD  hood  from  Ron  Artest  of  the  Houston  Rockets  or  markups  got  guide  good  mojo  any  Annie  this  Kevin  James  is  finally  funny  from  Perry's  easy  veto  know  of  the  San  Francisco  Giants  Zito  you  movie  move  lover  you  Jack  Jackie  even  took  the  time  to  install  instill  Twitter's  virgins  Virgin's  to  a  reporter  who  was  hounding  him  in  a  parking  lot  .

But  all  are  these  is  twittering  got  us  thinking  ,  what  does  the  service  mean  for  sports  journalism  in  the  way  athletes  interact  with  fans  well  because  Twitter  allows  at  least  athletes  a  to  draw  drill  will  deliver  messages  defense  fans  directly  in  many  mean  in  French  sports  writers  have  reacted  something  like  they  the  had  head  this  is  because  ,  as  noted  by  friend  friendly  of  the  shell  Chelan  and  funny  sportswriter  sports  around  Bill  Simmons  in  an  ESPN  the  The  Magazine  magazine  article  Twitter  means  that  the  athletes  don't  need  a  middleman  anymore  .

But  the  one  thing  about  athletes  in  and  Twitter  that  we  can  say  with  certainty  is  definitely  about  being  isn't  just  restricted  to  the  sports  world  .

Well  what  ,  we've  been  studying  Esther  Mr  concerning  concern  the  man  child  and  the  bride  and  we  discovered  that  asterisk  is  a  prophecy  of  our  prophecy  of  the  church  age  a  of  prophecy  of  are  our  that's  hidden  Esther  means  in  Hebrew  hidden  or  secret  and  ,  of  course  ,  history  mystery  as  is  a  bride  she's  hidden  in  and  secret  as  many  near  things  that  are  hidden  concerning  the  bride  concerning  revealing  the  brine  Brian  concerning  concern  in  ,  what  is  hidden  to  the  church  and  at  the  large  ,  of  course  ,  like  and  Song  of  Solomon  .  You  know  ,  the  bride  was  furiously  running  after  the  beloved  right  grind  .  He  it  there  was  more  important  to  her  to  seek  a  lower  than  it  was  to  the  rest  of  the  Queen's  Queens  in  the  county  bans  bands  in  and  the  virgins  and  it's  gone  home  with  the  army  without  Army  now  but  with  the  to  Rudd  bribe  .  This  is  serious  business  doesn't  .  They  stay  were  where  desired  earnestly  to  to  come  into  the  presence  of  the  master  Master  and  ,  in  the  first  chapter  of  Esther  Leicester  .  We  discovered  that  a  prophecy  that  showed  us  that  when  one  won  the  Lord  came  and  called  Israel  .  Here's  his  our  son  Old  Testament  bride  he  called  Israel  to  come  before  him  ,  and  they  refused  .  Just  as  they  have  had  swears  he  he's  refused  vanished  their  dashed  on  his  previous  Brown  Bryant  because  of  her  rebellion  and  in  night  coming  before  him  when  what  he  called  and  Lord  Jesus  called  call  and  he  got  no  answers  or  recover  recovery  a  few  answers  and  actually  actual  those  people  became  members  of  his  New  Testament  dry  and  ,  ,  so  we  thank  God  for  revelation  also  ,  there's  there  revelation  .  Towards  the  end  of  chapter  Chapter  one  of  the  bottle  Bible  itself  and  that  is  the  king  sent  forth  from  his  letters  in  and  all  the  languages  of  all  the  peoples  and  on  .  One  thing  they  said  that  I  thought  sure  your  it's  hitched  inched  thing  doing  is  that  it  he  could  not  be  altered  first  19  ,  could  not  cannot  be  altered  .  Once  the  command  the  Royal  royal  commandment  went  forth  fourth  .  They  could  not  be  altered  so  you  see  what's  been  being  said  he  here  is  was  very  ,  very  important  .  Also  ,  I  might  add  ,  in  Esther  Leicester  chapter  8  and  say  Versace  you  know  what  I  did  is  right  .  Best  Best  wrist  Jesus's  name  in  the  Jamaat  tree  is  eight  eight  eight  eight  years  is  his  is  number  8  is  as  Jesus's  Jesus  number  is  appears  here's  set  Chapter  to  reign  rein  eight  in  Versace's  says  right  .  She  you  also  to  the  Jews  as  it  pleases  to  you  in  the  King's  king's  name  and  seal  sailor  with  the  king's  reign  for  the  writing  ,  which  is  written  in  the  King's  king's  name  and  sealed  with  the  king's  Kings  King's  room  running  may  know  no  man  reverse  reversed  so  you  know  what  we  we  understand  from  that  there  that  we  have  to  be  very  careful  to  accept  only  the  doctrine  doctor  that  the  Lord  has  orders  given  us  .  In  his  letter  letters  right  and  not  try  tried  to  change  monopoly  amenable  mental  in  the  least  .  And  you  know  the  Bible  bottle  tells  us  ,  you  know  that  the  to  contend  earnestly  Paulson  calls  and  you  due  to  then  earnestly  for  the  faith  ,  which  was  once  delivered  on  and  to  the  Saints  saints  and  down  in  all  senses  of  that  fat  abiding  you  which  you  heard  from  the  beginning  ,  then  you  died  abide  in  the  The  sun  Sun  .  It's  is  very  important  divide  and  son  .  If  you  don't  abandon  son  you  don't  bear  fruit  .  If  you  don't  bear  fruit  in  arguably  be  in  the  brine  Bryant  .  You  see  so  sort  or  buying  by  buy  the  sun  son  Sun  Nissan  is  to  have  that  in  you  ,  which  you  heard  from  the  beginning  .  That  is  what  God  wrote  in  from  and  the  beginning  again  we  can  cannot  only  add  do  we  can  can't  take  away  from  .  To  do  so  is  first  cursed  look  at  the  last  five  versions  version  of  book  the  revolution  Revolution  so  ejected  to  begin  serious  seriousness  the  store  start  were  where  check  checked  chapter  ,  too  two  ,  because  there  isn't  is  there's  a  revelation  of  food  through  .  The  bride  is  ideas  and  in  what's  important  to  this  bribe  Bryant  interpreted  check  and  down  on  this  it  is  says  after  these  things  when  the  wrath  of  King  his  words  were  was  specified  pacified  .  He  remembered  best  are  time  and  what  she  had  done  and  what  was  decreed  the  against  her  then  ,  said  the  king  king's  servants  that  minister  Mister  Minister  Mr  down  done  to  him  .  Let  there  be  a  fair  fairy  young  virgins  sought  for  the  king  ,  and  that  let  the  king  King  appoint  appointed  officers  in  you  all  the  provinces  of  his  kingdom  that  they  may  make  gathered  gather  together  all  the  fair  fare  young  virgins  until  she  she's  share  in  the  palace  panels  to  the  house  of  the  women  and  to  the  custody  of  I  ATI  the  King's  king's  Chamber  chamber  on  the  keeper  of  the  women  and  are  our  that  let  but  there  their  things  for  purification  be  being  given  down  well  .  I  believe  that  Haiti  .  The  Kings  King's  king's  Chamberlain  here  represents  the  Holy  Spirit  .  He  is  the  keeper  of  the  women  it's  his  job  to  make  sure  that  these  women  are  beautiful  to  the  king  .  You  know  what  the  host  was  first  Birch  job  is  ,  of  course  ,  is  to  manifest  Jesus  Christ  ,  and  in  that's  us  now  ,  and  now  I  mean  ,  that's  what's  beautiful  to  the  king  priced  in  arch  a  right  shrine  hope  of  glory  and  as  Jesus  said  when  spoken  spoke  naked  Amos  about  having  to  be  born  borne  from  above  .  He  said  no  .  One  of  at  in  the  Senate  senate  send  in  into  heaven  body  that  descended  out  of  heaven  and  we  know  that  the  born  again  there  man  is  born  borne  from  .  But  the  word  of  God  that  it  comes  down  out  of  heaven  they  recreates  creates  in  us  that  their  spiritual  man  Jesus  Christ  the  Son  of  God  .  That's  also  the  manifestation  of  Sun  sun  son  chip  Chip  .  It's  very  important  ,  now  30  job  is  to  empower  this  process  and  it's  our  job  to  believe  that  the  border  word  or  .  God  guard  says  ,  so  that  we  give  him  them  authority  to  empower  this  process  and  so  notice  that  many  fair  fairer  young  virgins  were  gathered  together  in  a  they  Bryant  bride  was  going  to  be  chosen  from  among  these  and  matter  of  fact  ,  we  have  many  types  of  the  bride  in  the  scriptures  Song  song  of  Solomon  chapter  Chapter  six  is  as  is  of  the  bride  who  was  who's  running  after  her  beloved  arm  while  the  rest  of  the  Queen's  Queens  and  in  a  cocky  bans  buyers  divergence  didn't  seem  to  be  so  excited  about  doing  this  ,  you  know  ,  leaving  leading  questioner  question  .  What  is  your  beloved  about  above  another  .  But  how  we  watch  watched  what  will  make  sure  Jesus  and  any  inveterate  in  better  is  oranges  Jesus  you  know  basically  what  they're  are  saying  ,  but  I  like  what  it  says  here  in  on  chapter  Chapter  6  in  Mercedes  says  there  are  three  score  queens  Queens  Queen's  four  score  card  vans  and  in  Virgin's  virgins  without  number  .

She's  she  the  only  one  of  her  mother  ,  meaning  of  course  she's  she  not  alone  one  has  come  out  of  the  mother  mold  .  The  rest  of  these  his  are  still  job  our  a  are  corporate  body  of  the  mother  .  Right  .  She  is  an  the  only  all  one  of  her  .  Rather  other  ,  she  is  has  the  their  choice  .  One  of  her  that  bear  bare  and  the  their  daughters  saw  her  and  called  her  blessing  .  Here  the  Queen's  Queens  McCarthy  violence  bands  and  they  praised  her  folks  books  ,  it's  going  to  be  there  .  that  Why  way  .  This  is  also  a  prophecy  of  the  end  in  time  and  even  though  there  are  many  virgins  who  are  contending  for  to  the  be  this  bride  right  bright  not  everyone's  gonna  going  be  in  the  brine  so  false  documents  ,  not  script  Scripture  scripts  .  And  so  we  see  that  in  every  wants  on  Psalm  45  .  The  that  to  brought  the  same  thing  Virgin's  divergence  virgins  follow  following  followed  her  .

And  that's  why  this  is  so  important  a  to  church  Church  .  Of  course  ,  has  destroyed  this  move  ,  very  motivating  terrible  that  with  the  Lord  has  is  given  to  anti  dust  spiked  spike  Mike  ,  saying  that  the  whole  church  is  as  divine  .

You  see  ,  and  the  Holy  whole  Spirit  job  ,  of  course  ,  is  to  be  the  keeper  of  the  women  in  and  bring  paying  forth  that  fruit  .

And  so  they  don't  get  that  ,  because  I  they  don't  believe  the  real  gospel  but  but  this  the  spry  bride  believes  right  believes  a  the  word  of  God  .  She  wants  to  be  beautiful  to  too  the  king  ,  and  there  is  there's  nothing  that  will  make  you  beautiful  it  to  the  king  .

It  was  quite  seems  to  be  better  seeking  it  to  doing  it  ,  so  I  tried  try  trotted  the  Dow  out  with  kids  of  wanted  why  did  it  ,  and  frankly  to  office  all  offer  .

I  think  it's  far  less  transient  probably  Sydney  is  seems  seen  to  have  a  really  strong  community  as  wasn't  amazed  maze  maize  actually  the  fact  that  at  the  the  day  debut  though  that  when  we  first  came  here  in  the  eighties  was  this  his  as  half  harbors  .  Many  people  here  so  to  the  population  doubled  since  the  early  eighties  and  the  me  this  is  Pamela  Irwin  win  last  night  actually  did  and  tested  test  in  place  kicked  kicking  kick  off  here  ,  I've  never  heard  of  ,  and  him  it  to  be  honest  with  his  cool  school  and  he's  it's  really  cool  to  see  an  Australian  audience  .

She  uses  it  now  without  want  wanting  wants  to  kind  of  mix  and  scaring  many  lowly  positions  better  than  decays  K's  .  And  yet  here  .  How  do  you  guys  can  come  to  keep  the  the  cry  crave  it  uses  juices  cannot  sleep  see  with  we've  10  him  planned  to  turn  the  light  on  on  the  new  record  do  you  guys  actually  actively  at  search  for  new  inspiration  .  Did  eroded  do  they  come  do  you  think  if  you  search  searched  too  to  hard  Arjun  you  never  find  it  .  You  ,  you  have  to  better  edit  put  your  finger  on  it  is  what  what  you're  after  .  I  mean  ,  I  I'm  mean  the  timber  land  Justin  Timberlake  thing  we've  been  talking  about  for  a  couple  of  years  ,  and  it  any  sort  of  fell  into  place  at  the  right  time  ,  no  now  ,  I  do  did  .  We  don't  know  what  would  we'll  we're  do  doing  for  the  next  record  it  .  So  it's  all  always  it's  always  different  .  There's  talk  of  working  with  them  all  .  Ransom  Ronson  runs  is  .  Often  off  it's  that's  already  had  bags  died  ,  but  I  think  it's  a  combination  of  .  Keep  your  eyes  and  your  eyes  and  ears  open  .  I  on  mean  the  ,  we're  morning  into  contempt  temper  music  another  other  kinda  kind  guy  suggesting  suggested  held  expertise  music  explains  .  It  was  made  in  102  .

That's  tomorrow  yet  ruled  rule  will  the  plane  planet  and  then  ,  ,  then  we're  going  to  Jakarta  ,  the  day  today  afterwards  after  ,  you  know  now  ,  we're  gonna  going  go  through  the  Far  East  up  to  Japan  and  Hong  Kong  and  Korea  into  America  now  touring  Europe  maybe  South  America  they  Europe's  gonna  going  be  in  ,  well  ,  we  June  ,  July  and  going  on  here  .  ,  what  is  it  about  the  books  V  Festival  festival  in  particular  .

They  the  also  you  you've  tour  in  your  own  name  behavior  do  indeed  that  in  a  world  worldwide  wide  thing  think  .  But  there  is  some  .  I  think  there  is  something  quite  appealing  feeling  about  the  a  festival  fest  ,  sometimes  sometime  taking  when  they  got  get  a  bill  like  this  ,  because  we  tend  to  steer  clear  of  the  this  slightly  heavier  festivals  that  I  don't  think  our  audience  would  like  the  other  bands  bans  on  and  any  it  he  wouldn't  it  be  you  just  wouldn't  be  a  good  fit  .  But  with  this  when  one  we  were  we're  asked  to  do  it  and  we  saw  the  line  lineup  of  ,  which  was  complete  incomplete  .  At  that  stage  it  he  was  is  already  looking  great  with  the  Senate  state  an  opportunity  to  buy  play  to  a  lot  of  people  ,  it's  great  here  playing  outdoors  at  but  this  time  ,  the  and  yeah  yeah  people  get  to  see  a  lot  of  different  acts  which  are  I'm  stiffer  stiff  consuming  news  I  that's  know  the  I'm  one  really  glad  that  you  grace  Christ  Christ's  be  feet  scores  school  as  well  as  taking  time  out  from  the  from  firm  the  had  hectic  two  days  to  two  chat  chaps  to  me  the  Virgin  dot  com  .

It's  kind  of  a  new  idea  here  ,  but  it's  has  been  used  in  China  and  other  Asian  countries  for  over  a  thousand  years  and  a  billion  Chinese  people  get  be  me  the  wrong  and  can  they  but  are  here  in  the  West  .  We  thought  that  for  a  long  time  until  90  when  New  York  Times  reporter  James  Reston  wrote  about  how  inserting  needles  into  your  skin  could  help  relieve  pain  in  different  areas  .  But  it's  not  exactly  these  kinds  of  needles  acupuncture  needles  are  fine  finding  and  in  hair  like  there  there's  theirs  started  stored  sort  in  specific  parts  of  the  body  ,  which  according  to  traditional  Chinese  medicine  ,  helped  by  realigning  the  flow  of  cheap  your  body's  internal  energy  Western  western  medicine  still  struggle  struggled  struggles  to  explain  exactly  how  acupuncture  works  .  But  many  studies  have  shown  .  It  does  seem  to  help  .  In  recent  years  ,  acupuncture  has  become  more  popular  in  western  countries  is  now  recognized  by  the  National  Institute  of  Health  as  an  acceptable  form  of  treatment  for  pain  Doctor  Dr.  Lisa  Hollingsworth  of  Beverly  Hills  chiropractor  chiropractors  and  acupuncture  .  So  says  assess  some  adults  can't  be  skeptical  .  But  it's  a  much  easier  for  the  kids  wait  weight  yes  the  important  part  is  for  the  pair  to  sort  decided  of  set  it  up  before  they  come  in  ,  and  explain  explained  that  it  is  at  that  sea  see  .  The  visit  visited  the  acupuncture  rest  assist  I  or  chiropractors  chiropractor  is  nights  arms  scary  like  getting  likening  injection  in  and  getting  bloodline  John  line  .  And  in  that  is  something  that's  going  to  help  improve  their  performance  .  I  presented  as  something  cool  .  They  can  tell  their  friends  about  I  and  showed  show  them  the  Neil  they  feel  see  this  it's  its  tiny  that  then  it's  its  it  hair  like  and  they  think  it's  it  kind  of  quite  frightening  actually  sometimes  will  do  holding  one  well  myself  first  ,  just  justice  Justice  so  sell  the  them  it's  its  medics  pain  paying  .  You  know  ,  it's  very  ,  very  minimal  pain  not  now  like  it's  something  mean  pressed  pushed  them  like  a  vaccination  and  that  they're  more  like  will  more  pens  pins  Kearns  seem  seemed  to  be  more  receptive  and  mentally  adjust  just  it  not  now  neither  as  a  phrase  free  old  adults  Dole's  depending  on  what  the  presentation  of  and  them  then  .  The  child  is  if  they  have  an  injury  on  lot  a  of  10  city  do  local  acupuncture  points  on  the  side  of  the  pain  ,  be  it  near  in  and  call  on  the  her  shoulder  .  ,  and  if  they  have  something  more  involved  ,  like  asthma  symptoms  and  of  admires  admirers  search  such  ,  then  the  points  appoints  may  change  a  bit  .  Getting  seem  pretty  very  okay  with  it  ,  but  how  exactly  to  does  the  a  doctor  go  about  convincing  their  a  kid  to  sit  still  for  an  acupuncture  treatment  when  well  it's  hard  enough  to  get  a  child  to  is  sit  set  for  a  doctor  and  get  a  shot  and  that's  only  one  meal  needle  .  Another  thing  to  consider  about  acupuncture  is  that  it  has  almost  no  side  effects  like  pain  medication  can  generally  any  side  effects  are  were  or  caused  by  improperly  sterilized  needles  or  treatment  by  unqualified  practitioner  unqualified  that's  definitely  me  and  this  ,  in  fact  ,  is  not  the  right  needles  needle  .  So  let's  have  someone  who  is  qualified  and  understands  what  the  right  needles  are  and  how  now  they're  used  explain  to  us  exactly  how  this  treatment  is  as  administered  minister  each  acupuncture  needle  comes  neocons  individually  wrapped  their  this  sterile  or  their  there  one  time  use  only  .  And  then  did  you  come  in  a  variety  of  games  isn't  that  just  means  within  with  the  needle  and  this  is  a  very  fairly  small  and  announce  are  artist  announced  open  went  one  when  out  had  to  say  it's  an  impact  is  this  particular  type  of  meal  Neil  and  I'm  then  using  here  has  what  we  call  a  it  guide  dying  to  around  it  .  Not  all  of  them  like  this  but  the  guys  who  just  this  allows  precision  is  as  ,  you  know  ,  sort  of  an  easy  way  to  make  sure  getting  near  the  point  that  you  are  for  kids  .  I  they  use  a  smaller  gains  .  The  kids  are  really  being  partly  by  having  meals  in  just  a  matter  of  playing  applying  it  severely  airy  once  wanted  wants  a  puncture  puncher  .  And  I  can  just  to  myself  my  .  It  is  just  tax  tap  .  Then  ,  and  then  you  just  manipulate  down  acupuncture  is  have  a  very  fine  feel  you  can  fill  resistance  from  the  muscle  if  there's  there  an  injury  you  can  fill  body  party  barking  Mrs.  this  swelling  in  you  ,  you  know  how  deep  that  you  should  go  depending  on  the  area  .  It  varies  thank  you  so  much  .  Dr.  Hollingsworth  .
