  <description><![CDATA[St. Paul, MN - Watch as the GOP faithful go orgasmic over the prospect of giving away more oil fields to Exxon. <br /><br />But don&apos;t be surprised if they fail to do any drilling any time soon. Oil supply and profits are just about perfect, thank you very much.<br /><br />Rudy Giuliani, John McCain and Sarah Palin will not mention that, of course. Nor will they mention that their ticket is bought and paid for by big oil.<br /><br />This video has obviously been edited for effect. Link below if you would like to see raw footage. It&apos;s just as scary, if not more so. http://pdxk.com/media/rnc-giuliani-drill-baby-drill.mov<br /><br />Download and make your very own "Drill-Baby-Drill" mash up. It&apos;s fun AND frightening!]]></description>
