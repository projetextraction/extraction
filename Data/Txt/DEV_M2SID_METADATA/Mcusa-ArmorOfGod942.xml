  <description><![CDATA[It is possible to live the call in the United States. When we are enlisted and receive our uniform, the whole armor of God, we are outfitted like Jesus&#8212;the divine warrior whose weapons destroyed strongholds by saving, healing, teaching, delivering those captive to demons, loving enemies and even suffering. <br /><br /> Sisters and brothers, we stand as one body in a Superpower nation. We are an army of love, with truth telling as our belt, justice across our chest, wearing sandals of peace, headgear of salvation and packing the Word. This is an unmistakable uniform. We are at Christ&#8217;s command. <br /><strong><br /> Independence Day: </strong>The United States of America needs Mennonite Church USA to live the call. In the whole Christian family we are just one among siblings, but there is wisdom in this church. We have no need to protect the positions or privileges we have. God does not call us to preserve our wealth or our status but to give our lives for others. Soldiering is a sacrificial vocation. The Lord&#8217;s battle plan does not include self-preservation. Conversion means losing ourselves in order to gain Christ.]]></description>
