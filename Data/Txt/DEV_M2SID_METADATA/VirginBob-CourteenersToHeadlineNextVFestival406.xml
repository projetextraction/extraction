  <description><![CDATA[Liam Fray from The Courteeners says they&apos;ll headline the UK V Festival at Chelmsford and Stafford next year, probably. Okay - so I kind of pushed him in to making that statement and I immediately felt soiled and dirty like some gutter-dwelling tabloid hack but hey, all&apos;s fair in love, rock&apos;n&apos;roll and trying to get that exclusive backstage scoop. I had a lined up a whole series of guffaw-inducing, oh-so-clever and highly original either/or questions for the mighty Liam Courteener (as you can see from our other V Festival clips)... until he said he was pissed off coz the previous interviewer had asked him a load of really crap either/or questions. Oh. So here I am clenching my butt cheeks and gritting my teeth under a fixed grin trying make polite conversation with a burgeoning rock legend who thinks I&apos;m a bit of a dick for not asking decent, probing and intelligent questions. This job is quite hard sometimes you know.]]></description>
