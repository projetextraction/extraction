  <title><![CDATA[US Iraq Policy Needs a Strategic Reset - Dr Lawerence Korb On Reclaiming US Security in the Middle E]]></title>
  <description><![CDATA[<p>With the Iraq war well into its fifth year, the Bush administration still lacks a realistic plan for the Middle East and Iraq. The United States must reclaim control of its core national security interests by taking active steps to stabilize the entire Middle East and abandon the delusions at the heart of President BushÃ¢â&#130;¬â&#132;¢s policies. Otherwise, U.S. security will continue to suffer by weakening the U.S. military and draining resources away from destroying terrorist networks such as Al Qaeda.</p><p>The current Iraq strategy is exactly what Al Qaeda wantsÃ¢â&#130;¬â&#128;&#157;the United States distracted and pinned down by IraqÃ¢â&#130;¬â&#132;¢s internal conflicts and trapped in a quagmire that has become the perfect rallying cry and recruitment tool for Al Qaeda. The United States has no good options given the strategic and tactical mistakes made on Iraq since 2002, but simply staying the course with an indefinite military presence is not advancing U.S. interests.</p><p>Instead, the United States must reset its strategy by looking beyond the deteriorating situation in Iraq in order to counter the threat from global terrorist groups and ensure stability in the entire Middle East and Gulf region. To do this, we need to develop a new overall Middle East strategy, not just a series of tactics focused heavily on Iraq.</p><p><a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/">www.americanprogress.org</a></p><p> </p>]]></description>
