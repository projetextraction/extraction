  <description><![CDATA[A tall, well-built man with huge eyes and a rugged jaw. Radovan Karadzic rose from a tiny Montenegrin village to Sarajevo University, fame as a poet and, finally, to President of the Republika Srpska -- and infamy as one of the world&apos;s most wanted war criminals. An intellectual, Karadzic was known to recite verses, accompanying himself on a guitar. But his real instrument was the manipulation. He played Serbian insecurity like a lute. Inhaling popular doubt and anxiety -- about power, money, race and the future... and exhaling racism, nationalism, pride, a sense of wronged entitlement... Villagers became killers, neighbor against neighbor as if they were drunk on fear and lust for power. And the world watched. A deadly combo. The world watched again, when Karadzic was arrested Monday and there were those who asked; How is it that an intellectual and a poet could do such things? We like to think that people like this--the educated ones, the sophisticated ones, the poets for heaven sake --should know better. Don&apos;t they have higher moral standards that ordinary people? Maybe Karadzic wasn&apos;t really a poet. Or a super bad one. Or maybe the question&apos;s wrong. We wish that war criminals like Karadzic, were "monsters." Because that would be a comforting thought. Then they would be different, genetically, biologically, physically different . And the rest of us could relax. But those who commit genocide aren&apos;t born, they make choices. And they don&apos;t alone. And monsters are made of regular men and women like us. It takes a village. Tonight on GRITtv, we look back at the genocidal career of Radovan Karadzic in Bosnia with filmmaker Ilan Ziv and journalist Stacy Sullivan.]]></description>
