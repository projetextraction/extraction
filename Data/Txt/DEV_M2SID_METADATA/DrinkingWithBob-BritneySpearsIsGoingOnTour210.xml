  <description><![CDATA[What&apos;s next? I&apos;ll tell you what&apos;s next... Britney Spears. I&apos;m listening to the radio before and that half a fag, Ryan Seacrest comes on. He starts telling me how Britney Spears is going on tour. Everybody is worried if she is gonna make it. Is she gonna hold up during the tour? She&apos;s going on tour for 45 days. She is going to take every other day off. She is gonna sing 20 songs a night. And we&apos;re worried if she is gonna hold up?! The average person works 5 days a week. 8 hours a day. 40 hours a freaking week. Nobody&apos;s concerned about them! Does somebody follow the freaking mailman down the street cheering him on? Come on Billy! You can do it, one more letter! Just one more letter! Is anyone concerned about the freaking fireman walking into a burning building? Does anyone go in after him, to make sure he&apos;s safe? How bout the nurse, who&apos;s working a 16 hour shift, because her replacement called in sick? Nobody gives a damn about her. Why? Because we&apos;re all worried about Britney Spears. Let me tell you something about Britney Spears. She doesn&apos;t belong on stage. She belongs in a freaking mental institution! The girl is out of her freaking mind!! And if you bought a ticket, to the Britney Spears show, you belong in a metal institution right next to her! Are you kidding me?! This girl is a piece of trash! She should be laying in a city dump next to a half eaten tuna fish sandwich. She&apos;s garbage! She&apos;s a piece of freaking garbage!! if the record companies didn&apos;t think they could make another couple of dollars off of this girl. She&apos;d be living in a slum in Louisiana, eating dirt off of the freaking floor and talking to herself! The best thing that could happen! The best thing that could happen! is that, at Britney Spears first show, Chris Brown shows up and beats the hell out of her! This way we don&apos;t have to hear about this for another month and a half! Britney Spears is going on tour? Britney Spears is going on tour?! Who freaking cares?! Who freaking cares?!! what&apos;s next! what&apos;s next!! what&apos;s next!!!]]></description>
