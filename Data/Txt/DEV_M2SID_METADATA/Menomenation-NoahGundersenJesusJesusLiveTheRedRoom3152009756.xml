  <description><![CDATA[<p><span><a href="http://www.myspace.com/noahgundersen">www.myspace.com/noahgundersen</a></span>Â </p><p>Noah Gundersen writes to the soul. His lyrics touch on all levels of the human condition: the sorrow, the joy, the love, the fear, and the longing. The spirit of the middle class American. Coupled with dynamic musicianship, the music makes for a vibrant and engaging experience, both live and on disc. Drawing from the influence of Ryan Adams, Wilco, and Counting Crows, this young artist is creating music in a brand new world. <br /><br />The first thing you&#39;ll notice about Noah is that he&#39;s a young man. When you hear him sing, you&#39;ll wonder how old his heart is. Combining deeply personal lyrics, acoustic folk-rock guitar work, and a passionate voice, Noah creates emotive songs for his listeners. He expresses personal thoughts in hope that "someone will hear a song and be touched somewhere in their heart that often goes by unnoticed." <br />- The Sisters Folk Festival <br /><br />"Brand New World" gives us a steady, surging feel, a swelling of distended guitars and atmospheric violin. Noah&#39;s vocals-soaring melodies, death-defying emotional acrobatics and pipes that could wail the phonebook and make it sound like a suicide note, make a messy, multidimensional celebration of life. <br />- Patrick Adickes, The Emerald Scene <br /><br />Gundersen&#39;s voice is a multifaceted, subtle thing that imbues his quiet folk with a sense of urgency and importance that acoustic strumming alone could never convey. If you&#39;re even a passing fan of Sufjan Stevens, Josh Ritter or Conor Oberst, Gundersen&#39;s your man. <br />- Jeff Echert, The Pacific Northwest Inlander <br /><br />Go see this dude play a show. Gundersen&#39;s voice is powerful and versatile, yet raw; there are shades of Damien Rice and Adam Duritz -- clear influences reflected in his songs. He has a talent for writing melodies, and has a refreshing presence, void of pretension, contrived emotion, or arrogance. I read a review somewhere that categorized Noah&#39;s music as Christian Rock. That&#39;s bunk. Gundersen&#39;s music had an honesty that can&#39;t be found anywhere in that genre. Can&#39;t wait to hear where he is headed next. <br />- Pete, a fan <br /><br />I don&#8217;t know of any other young northwest artist with the ambition to release a live album. Recording a concert is challenging because what you play is exactly what&#8217;s captured, mistakes included. But this album is engaging because it&#8217;s raw and gutsy. <br />- Tommy, Garage Voice </p>]]></description>
